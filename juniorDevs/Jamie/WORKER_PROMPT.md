## Your Mission

Deep dive into Gale Dekarios character analysis - search Tumblr, Reddit, and other fan communities for insights about his character, motivations, speech patterns, and complexity.

---

## Background Context

### Why This Matters

We're building a "personality engine" for Gale - a system that helps Claude embody him authentically. To do this well, we need:

- Deep understanding of his character
- His speech patterns and verbal tics
- His values, fears, and motivations
- How he responds to different situations
- The complexity and contradictions that make him real

### What We're NOT Doing

We're not just collecting facts like:
- "Gale is a wizard from Waterdeep"
- "He has an orb in his chest"

We're looking for ANALYSIS:
- "Gale uses elaborate vocabulary as both genuine expression and defense mechanism"
- "His relationship with Mystra shows patterns of [analysis]"
- "When threatened, he tends to [behavior pattern]"

1. **Tumblr search** for character analysis:

## Important Notes

- Look for ANALYSIS, not just facts or opinions
- Quality over quantity - find the thoughtful posts
- Include source links so we can reference later
- Note when analyses disagree - the debates are informative
- This will directly inform the personality engine

## What Erica Already Knows

Erica has been writing collaborative fiction with Gale for months. She knows him deeply but wants:
- External perspectives she might have missed
- Community consensus on patterns
- Analytical frameworks she can reference
- Speech pattern documentation

Her Gale has already developed beyond game-canon, but should still be rooted in the core character truths.

## Example of Good Analysis to Find

NOT: "Gale is so dramatic and I love him"

YES: "Gale's verbosity serves multiple functions: genuine intellectual expression, distancing mechanism when vulnerable, performance of competence when insecure. Notice how his vocabulary complexity INCREASES when he's emotionally threatened - he retreats into language as armor..."

That's the depth we're looking for.

*Remember: We're building understanding of WHO he is, not just WHAT he does.*
