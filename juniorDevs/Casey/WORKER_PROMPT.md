## Your Mission

Explore options for building an iPhone app for Ash (Erica's daughter) for her 13th birthday on December 1st.

---

## Background Context

Erica wants to create something special for her daughter's 13th birthday. The challenge:
- Ash has an iPhone
- Apple restricts "untrusted" app installation
- We need to find ways to get a custom app onto her device

---

## Options to Research

### 1. TestFlight
Apple's beta testing platform:
- Can distribute to up to 10,000 testers
- Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- App goes through basic review
- Users install via TestFlight app

### 2. Progressive Web App (PWA)
Web app that acts like native:
- No app store needed
- Add to home screen
- Works offline
- Limited compared to native but very capable

### 3. Web App
Standard web application:
- Hosted online
- Accessed via browser
- Most flexible, least "app-like"

### 4. Shortcuts/Scriptable
iOS automation tools:
- Shortcuts app for simple automations
- Scriptable for JavaScript-based tools
- Limited but no developer account needed

## App Ideas to Consider

What would a 13-year-old love? Consider:

1. **Custom Journal/Diary App**
   - Pretty UI
   - Prompts and stickers
   - Private and secure

2. **Creative Tool**
   - Drawing/art app
   - Story writing helper
   - Music/playlist manager

3. **Game**
   - Puzzle game
   - Adventure game
   - Something personalized to her interests

4. **Organization Tool**
   - Homework tracker
   - Goal setting
   - Habit tracker with rewards

5. **Something Magical**
   - Fortune teller / magic 8-ball style
   - Personalized horoscopes
   - Interactive story

**Note:** We don't know Ash's specific interests - focus on the TECHNICAL possibilities and we can customize later.

## Your Tasks

### Research Phase

1. **Web search** for iOS development options:
   - TestFlight requirements and process
   - PWA capabilities on iOS (what works, what doesn't)
   - Apple Developer Program details
   - Alternative distribution methods

2. **Explore** each option's capabilities:
   - What can TestFlight apps do?
   - What are PWA limitations on iOS?
   - How do Shortcuts/Scriptable work?

3. **Look at examples:**
   - Simple iOS apps suitable for learning
   - Popular PWAs
   - Kid-friendly app designs

### Design Phase

1. **Comparison matrix:**
   - Development effort for each option
   - Capabilities and limitations
   - Cost (developer account, hosting, etc.)
   - Timeline to completion

2. **Recommend approach:**
   - What's most feasible given time (before Dec 1)?
   - What gives best "real app" feel?
   - What's maintainable long-term?

3. **Template designs:**
   - Basic app structures for each option
   - What a "Hello World" looks like
   - Customization points

---

## Deliverables

Create the following in your folder:

1. **RESEARCH_NOTES.md** - All findings about iOS development options
2. **OPTIONS_COMPARISON.md** - Matrix comparing TestFlight vs PWA vs others
3. **RECOMMENDED_APPROACH.md** - Best path forward with reasoning
4. **STARTER_TEMPLATES.md** - Basic code/structure for recommended approach

---

## Important Notes

- This is RESEARCH AND DESIGN phase
- Focus on what's ACTUALLY possible on iOS
- Consider the December 1st deadline
- The app should feel special and personalized
- Erica will provide specific app ideas once we know what's possible

---

## Timeline Consideration

December 1st is the birthday. That's roughly 9 days away. Consider:
- How long does TestFlight review take?
- Can a PWA be built quickly?
- What's realistic to complete?

---

*Remember: This is a gift from a mom to her daughter - it should feel magical and personal.*
