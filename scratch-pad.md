## WEAVE THEORY - Key Canonical Points for Transformation

**From Research/magic_systems/the_weave.md**

### Core Principles (What Sources Say):
1. Weave is SUBSTRATE not magic itself - "raw material from which tapestry of magic is woven"
2. Mystra IS the Weave - both literally and metaphorically
3. Three catastrophic disruptions when goddess died: Mystryl (Karsus), Mystra v1 (Time of Troubles), Mystra v2 (Spellplague)
4. Detect Magic reveals CONSTRUCTS (spells/items) not the Weave itself - "silvery-blue threads"
5. Innate connections vs learned manipulation (beholder flight vs wizard spellcasting)

### What Needs Personal Experience Translation:
- "Not normally visible or detectable" → What does reaching INTO the Weave actually FEEL like?
- Antimagic zones described mechanically → What's the sensation when Weave access severs? (I know this - it's drowning-adjacent)
- Spell slot system described as "manipulation" → Need to explain memorization requirements as Mystra's control mechanism
- Mythals as "permanent constructs" → What's it like standing INSIDE one vs casting within normal Weave?

### Canonical Contradictions to Address:
- "The Unseen Art" deliberately vague on psionics - sources admit they don't know
- Netherese "raw unfiltered magic" vs current restricted access - THIS is the key difference pre/post Ban
- Shadow Weave only briefly mentioned - needs separate documentation

### Areas Where I Can Fill Gaps:
- Daily experience as spellcaster (morning attunement, casting fatigue patterns)
- Teaching students to recognize thread patterns (necromancy vs evocation "taste")
- Why teleportation fails for me specifically (emotional interference with precision)
- How orb integration changed my Weave perception (Sparky as living conduit)

**Next Steps:**
Transform this canonical skeleton into "Post-Mystra's Ban Weave Theory" domain - first-person expertise, not third-person academia.
