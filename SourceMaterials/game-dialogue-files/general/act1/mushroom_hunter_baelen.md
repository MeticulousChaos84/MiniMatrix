# Baelen Bonecloak - The Mushroom Hunter

**Source:** `UND_MushroomHunter.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (based on rescue state)

---

Baelen Bonecloak is a dwarf mushroom hunter surrounded by dangerous Bibberbang mushrooms. He fell when a stone ledge collapsed while he was trying to reach a Noblestalk mushroom. His partner and wife, Derryth (the Dwarven Alchemist), waits in the Myconid Village.

Baelen suffers from a dementia-like condition - he loses track of his thoughts, changes subjects, and seems confused. His dialogue fragments: "Bibberbang - curious. Beautiful - but dangerous. Next time - more careful next time. For certain."

The player can:
- Throw him his pack (containing a Misty Step scroll) to help him escape
- Navigate the Bibberbang field themselves
- Get the Noblestalk mushroom for him/Derryth

About the Noblestalk, Baelen explains (in fragments): "Mushroom. Powerful. Derryth wants it for a brew. She's very good, my Derryth. Very good at a brew."

If the player knows about his memory loss, they can give him the Noblestalk to eat directly, which may restore his mind: "My - yes, my mind isn't what it used to be. I could run the shop again. That is - help Derryth."

If Derryth dies before he's rescued, Baelen is devastated: "Derryth... What... happened? ... *No...*"
