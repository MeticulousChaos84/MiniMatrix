---

Crusher is a goblin telling stories to his lackeys when the player interrupts. Annoyed, he wants to humiliate them by either branding them or making them kiss his foot.

## The Scene

Crusher is bragging: "...thrashed 'is arm with my bare hands. Weaker than pixies, humans."

When the player approaches, he mocks them based on their race: "And who're you? 'Nother pest? [Race]... think ya rule the world. Hah!"

## Humiliation Options

Crusher offers the player a choice: get branded with his mark, or kiss his foot in front of everyone.

After being branded with Crusher's mark:

**Astarion:** "I know we don't want to draw attention, but you could've at least bitten off a toe."

**Gale:** "Quick thinking! At least there's a silver lining to having yourself horribly scarred for life."

After kissing Crusher's foot:

**Astarion:** "Two hundred years of slavery, and that was still the most humiliating thing I've ever seen."

**Gale:** "Don't take this the wrong way, but I think I've just lost all respect for you."

When asked about what happened:

**Astarion:** "No? I want to hear every sordid detail."
