Alfira is a young tiefling bard who was apprenticed to a woman called Lihala. On their journey to the Grove, they were attacked by gnolls and Lihala died horribly. Alfira is trying to compose a song in honour of the teacher she loved so dearly, but is struggling.

This is a soft and touching moment in the Grove.

## The Scene

If the player convinced her to give up music, Alfira is devastated: "I'm not cut out to be a bard. Or much else, if I'm honest... Guess I'll see what Baldur's Gate brings."

If her lute is stolen, she's frantic: "It was right here. Someone must have taken it."

The player asks why she needs another instrument: "It was my teacher's. And it's - it's all I have left."

## Helping Alfira

The player can:
- Help her play through the song
- Talk her through the lyrics
- Steal her instrument
- Convince her to give up music
- Return the lute if stolen: "I'm not going to ask where you got this. Just... thank you. Now, please leave."

If the player helps her finish the song, Alfira stands and performs it in a cinematic scene - a touching tribute to her lost teacher.
