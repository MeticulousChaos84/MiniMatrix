**Starting Node:** 5

---

An encounter with Gauntlet Dain, a Flaming Fist soldier at Waukeen's Rest. The player can encounter her in different states depending on the condition of the burning inn.

**Synopsis:**
Gauntlet Dain can be found either trying to put out fires during the initial rescue, or later investigating tracks in the aftermath. She's trying to piece together what happened during the goblin and drow raid that resulted in Grand Duke Ravengard's kidnapping.

**Different States:**

**During the Fire:**
- Dain: "You're no help just standing there. Help us!"
- Dain: "Can't you see the inn is burning?! Help or get out of the way!"

**After the Inn Burns Down:**
- Dain: "The tracks converge here. Two, maybe three drow. At least one of ours."
- Dain: "From here they went... Damn! It's all so confused."
- She's kneeling, studying tracks that were mostly destroyed by the fire

**Player Interactions:**
- Offer to help investigate the tracks (Investigation DC 10)
- Share information about Moonrise Towers if known
- Claim to be a guard from a nearby village (Deception DC 10)
- Search her mind for information (Detect Thoughts)
- Deliberately destroy the evidence

**Key Information:**
- Drow and goblins raided the inn
- The Grand Duke was taken
- Tracks lead south
- The counsellor (Florrick) may have survived

If the player successfully reads tracks: "*You notice the tell-tale clumsiness of goblins, alongside something more light-footed - drow. Your gaze follows the drow footprints around the courtyard and south - out of the inn.*"
