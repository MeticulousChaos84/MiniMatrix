# Duergar Camp Checkpoint - Morghal

**Source:** `UND_DuergarCamp_Checkpoint.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (based on player race and state)

---

Morghal is a duergar guard at the checkpoint leading to the Grymforge mining camp. She's hostile and suspicious of outsiders, threatening violence immediately upon approach.

Morghal growls: "Got any reason I shouldn't sever your head and toss it to the rothé?"

A random companion may interject based on party composition, either advising caution or expressing their own frustration with the encounter.

The player can:
- Try to pass peacefully
- Threaten violence in return
- Use various skills to convince her they're not a threat
- Reveal their True Soul status if branded

Morghal guards access to the Grymforge where the duergar are excavating for the Absolute. Getting past her requires either diplomacy, intimidation, or aligning with the cult.

**Astarion:** "Another belligerent dwarf? This is getting tiresome."

*Other companions also have lines - Lae'zel ("Let her try. My thirst for blood has yet to be quenched."), Shadowheart ("Let's try and keep this diplomatic."), Karlach ("Not in the mood for another fight"), Wyll ("I reckon diplomacy may be in order")*
