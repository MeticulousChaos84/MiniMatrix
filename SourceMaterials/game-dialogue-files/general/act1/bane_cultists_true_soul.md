# Bane Cultists - Death of a True Soul

**Source:** `FOR_PriestOfTheConqueringGod_Cultists.html`
**Starting Node:** 37

---

The party encounters Andrick and Brynna, two novices of the Absolute attending to their injured True Soul leader, Ed. He recognizes the player as tadpoled and tells his novices they're trustworthy, but the novices aren't convinced.

## The Scene

Brynna pleads with the dying True Soul: "You're a True Soul. You can't die. Please stay with us."

When the player approaches, Brynna becomes defensive: "You! Not a step closer."

The player can use their tadpole connection to communicate with the dying True Soul, who confirms the player's status to his novices.

## Companion Reactions

After interacting with the True Souls:

**Gale:** "That fellow had a tadpole in his head, and they consider him blessed? Chosen? What madness is this?"

**Astarion:** "Oh, I like these two. All zeal and no brains."

## Outcomes

The player can:
- Order the novices to leave the area
- Send them to find the creature that attacked their leader
- Let them continue their vigil
