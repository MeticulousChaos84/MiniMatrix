# Priestess Gut - Chapel Dialogue

**Source:** `GOB_GoblinPriest_Chapel.html`
**Starting Node:** 31

True Soul Gut is a goblin priestess and one of three leaders in the goblin camp. She's a True Soul - tadpoled but unaware, believing she communes directly with the Absolute. She's charismatic and friendly in a crude way, but her offers of help are a ploy to separate players from their friends so she can imprison them and watch the parasite consume them.

## The Offer

Gut offers to "clear your head" and help with the tadpole. She wants to perform this in private.

When the player accepts her help:
- Approval: Astarion -1, Karlach +1

Gut says: "Smart. All you need to do is open yourself to the Absolute, and I'll do the rest."

## The Mind Reading

Psionic feelers creep across the player's mind. The player can:
- Seal their mind against the intrusion
- Relax and show her the memory of infection
- Shut her out completely

If the player seals their mind, Gut notices: "It's all slippery in there. What are you hiding?"

## Opportunity

When alone with Gut:

**Astarion:** "There's no one here. Can we *please* kill her and get on with our day?"

## The Trap

If the player goes along with Gut's "help," she leads them to a private room where she attempts to imprison them.
