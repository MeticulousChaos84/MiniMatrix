# Karlach - First Meeting and Recruitment

**Source:** `PLA_KarlachRecruitment_Karlach_PostEA.html`
**Starting Node:** 13 (standard) / 34 (after killing tieflings)

---

Karlach is a tiefling fugitive hiding from cultists trying to drag her back to Hell. She's fierce and defiant but also friendly and grateful if helped. The dialogue begins with a stream separating her from the player as she holds them at bay with a crossbow.

## First Meeting

Karlach greets the player: "Please tell me you come in peace. Last fucker who came through here properly blew out my candles."

If the player has killed the Grove tieflings, Karlach confronts them: "I know what you did. All those people in the druid's grove - you slaughtered them to a man. Did it make you feel important, huh? Did it make you feel big?"

## Recruitment

When the player considers recruiting Karlach:

**Astarion:** "You want to just team up with some blood-stained killer? Because I'm fine with that."

OR (if Lae'zel is present):

**Astarion:** "She's almost as scary as you, Lae'zel. So naturally she gets my vote."

**Gale:** "She's, erm, perhaps a little rough around the edges... but I suppose I can be smooth enough for two..."

## Party Swap

When companions are sent back to camp to make room:

**Astarion:** "If I must. But do try to keep them safe - they're a little useless without me."

**Astarion:** "Oh, gladly. This circus is all yours, my friend."

**Astarion:** "I would object, but sitting by the fire while you do all the hard work sounds marvellous, actually."

**Gale:** "I'll get little rest given the stack of unread books waiting for me - but I'll try."

**Gale:** "The mind is strong, but the knees... well, they are a little sore. I'll gladly put my feet up."

**Gale:** "Keeping your greatest weapon in reserve, eh? An excellent strategy."
