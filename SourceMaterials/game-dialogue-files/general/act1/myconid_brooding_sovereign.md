**Source:** `UND_MyconidCircle_BroodingSovereign.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (based on quest state)

---

Spaw is the Sovereign of the Myconid Circle - a fungal leader who communicates through spores and telepathy. The myconids have been threatened by duergar raids from the nearby camp.

Spaw is peaceful but protective of the Circle. When approached, Spaw reads the player's mind through the spore connection and assesses their intentions.

Key dialogue branches:
- **Learning about Myconids:** Spaw explains their peaceful, harmonious existence
- **The Duergar Threat:** The raids have terrified the Circle - Spaw asks for help
- **Revenge Quest:** Spaw asks the player to kill True Soul Nere as revenge for the duergar's attacks on the Circle
- **Rewards:** Spaw offers gratitude and unique myconid-crafted items

The Sovereign can share information about:
- The Underdark ecosystem
- The duergar excavation
- Other beings in the area (Blurg, the Society of Brilliance)

Spaw speaks in the calm, measured tones typical of myconid communication - sharing thoughts directly mind-to-mind rather than using spoken words.
