# Goblin Camp - Checkpoint Entry

Sentinel Olak guards the checkpoint to the Goblin Camp. He's an evil, nasty character who oozes disdain - the first goblin encountered, setting the tone for their weaselly, cruel, wicked nature. He will only let non-allied players in if they smear worg dung on their face.

## The Encounter

Olak greets visitors by threatening to feed them to his worg: "Lookit, Klaw! Supper's here."

For allied players, he's relatively friendlier: "Only funnin'. Got word from Moonrise?"

When the player approaches:

**Gale:** "Let's try to be diplomatic, shall we? Goblins don't come by the handfuls, but by the dozens."

## Getting Inside

The player can:

**Claim to have a message for the leader (Deception DC 10):**
- Success: "Right. Dror Ragzlin's inside, in through the temple. Better have good news..."
- Failure: "Don't know Dror Ragzlin's name? Bit odd, don't you think, lads?"

**Use tadpole powers** to command entry

**Attack** (initiates combat)

**Accept the humiliation** - smear worg dung on their face to enter

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Let's try to be diplomatic, shall we? Goblins don't come by the handfuls, but by the dozens."
