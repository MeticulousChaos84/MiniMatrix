Kith'rak Therezzyn, captain of Creche Y'llek, interrogates the player about a missing githyanki "weapon." This conversation reveals critical information:
1. The githyanki's missing weapon and the Astral Prism artefact are THE SAME object
2. The githyanki were planning to attack Moonrise Towers

## First Meeting (Non-Githyanki Player)

The captain addresses the player with disgust, calling them an "istik" (outsider) and asking if they are one of the mercenaries sent to bring the weapon.

If Lae'zel is present, she speaks up to vouch for the player, saying the outsider is with her. Therezzyn acknowledges this but presses for an answer about the weapon.

The Dream Visitor telepathically warns the player: "Don't tell her anything."

The player can:

**Claim to have the weapon:**
- The captain demands to see it
- If the player produces the artefact, the captain uses her psionics to pull it toward her
- The artefact zaps her, protecting itself
- She's impressed and grants access to the Inquisitor

**Claim there's a traitor among the githyanki:**
- Must have Lae'zel accuse the doctor first in party dialogue
- Lae'zel confirms the player speaks the truth
- The captain asks who they accuse:
  - "Your doctor" (the ghustil)
  - "Kith'rak Voss" (the Supreme Knight)
  - Refuse to say, demanding to see the Inquisitor
- Therezzyn dismisses vague accusations but still wants the weapon

**Ask about the weapon/what it looks like:**
- Therezzyn explains they seek an object of great power

**Say they seek aid against the ghaik (mind flayer) incursion:**
- Therezzyn redirects to the weapon question

## First Meeting (Githyanki Player)

Lae'zel greets the captain formally: "Honoured kith'rak. May Vlaakith show us truth."

The captain addresses the player as "ra'stil" (ally) rather than istik, asking if they bring news of the weapon.

## Return Visits

If the player returns without the weapon:
- Therezzyn demands to know if they have news
- Failing a Deception check (DC 16) to buy more time results in combat
- Passing allows the player to leave

After resolving the Templar situation:
- Therezzyn tells the player to finish their business and leave
