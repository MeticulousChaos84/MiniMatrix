# Zaith'isk - Purification Device Experience

**Source:** `CRE_GithInfirmary_Device.html`
**Starting Node:** 128 (standard) / 67 (after doctor intro) / 29 (Lae'zel using it)

---

The player attempts to remove their tadpole using the zaith'isk, a githyanki purification device made of taut flesh and pockmarked metal. The device is designed to kill the user while extracting the parasite - a fact the player doesn't know. They have opportunities to save themselves, and if they fail, the Dream Visitor (Daisy) will intervene.

## Initial Approach

When the player examines the device, the Narrator notes it waits for something, and the tadpole stirs.

If the player looks to their companions for guidance:

**Astarion:** "I'm all for it, but... well, you first."

**Gale:** "Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try."

Other companions also comment:
- Wyll: "It's only a horrific machine of unspeakable form. What's the worst that could happen?"
- Shadowheart: "I don't like the look of this thing. Its 'cure' could be a metal bolt punched through your skull."
- Karlach: "Never stick your head in an extraplanar torture device. A rule to live by."
- Lae'zel (if denied her turn): "You deny me my due, then seek my comfort? *Bah*. Sit, and be pure."

## The Experience

The doctor (Ghustil Stornugoss) instructs the player to take their place and focus on the parasite. The device clamps around the player's head, neck, and shoulders, locking them in with a psychic forcefield.

As the process intensifies, the device starts to damage the player (reducing INT, WIS, and CON). The player has opportunities to resist or escape.

When things go dangerously wrong:

**Astarion:** "What are you doing? Turn it off!"

**Gale:** "There has to be a way to stop this thing!"

At the critical moment when the device threatens to kill them:

**Astarion:** "It's too much, you can't take it. Get out of there, now!"

**Gale:** "That's no cure - it's going to kill you. Get out!"

## Outcomes

**Player escapes/resists:** The device may explode, but the player survives with stat damage.

**Dream Visitor intervenes:** If the player fails to save themselves, Daisy breaks them free.

**Lae'zel uses the device (if allowed):** She has a different, more devotional experience calling to Vlaakith.
