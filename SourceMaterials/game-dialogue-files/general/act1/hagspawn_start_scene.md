**Source:** `HAG_Hagspawn_StartScene.html`
**Starting Node:** 20

---

The player enters Auntie Ethel's Teahouse to find her with Mayrina, the pregnant woman from the roadside encounter. This is where Ethel's true nature as a hag begins to become apparent, and the player can choose to confront her about Mayrina or even make a deal concerning their tadpole.

**Synopsis:**
Auntie Ethel is ordering Mayrina to eat, using a cheerful granny voice that barely conceals the menace beneath. When she notices the player, her demeanor shifts depending on previous encounters. If the player sided against her at the roadside, she demands an apology. The player can apologize, refuse, or challenge her outright.

**Key Elements:**
- Ethel: "I don't want a crumb left on that plate, girl."
- Mayrina: "Auntie Ethel, please. One more bite and this pie is gonna come back up to say hello."
- Ethel: "Don't make me get the wooden spoon. You're eating for two, so get to it!"
- The hag offers to remove the player's tadpole in exchange for an eye
- Multiple ways to challenge or submit to her

**Player Approaches:**
- Apologize for previous confrontation
- Refuse to apologize and challenge her
- Ask about Mayrina
- Inquire about tadpole removal
- Various race/class-specific responses (Gith: "Gith apologise to no one.")

**The Deal:**
Ethel can offer to remove the tadpole, but her price is steep - the player must give up an eye. Like all hag deals, this is not what it seems and has significant consequences.
