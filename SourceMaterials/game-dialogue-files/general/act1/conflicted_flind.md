# The Conflicted Flind - Gnoll Pack Leader

---

A unique telepathic encounter with a Flind - the monstrous leader of a gnoll pack. Unlike normal gnolls who would attack on sight, this Flind has been infected with a mind flayer tadpole, creating an internal "Voice" that forbids it from attacking certain prey - including the player.

**Synopsis:**
The gnolls are ravenously attacking travelers near a cave, but the Flind suddenly halts its attack when sensing the player's tadpole. A psychic connection forms, and the player experiences the gnoll's conflicting urges - its overwhelming hunger versus the Voice's commands to leave this "forbidden meat" alone.

**Key Moments:**
- Narrator: "*With a shock of psychic pain, the pack leader's mind clamps onto yours.*"
- Narrator: "*You see yourself through her eyes - a pulsing red cluster of organs. FEAST! No... the Voice has forbidden this meat.*"
- The Voice restrains the Flind from attacking True Souls
- An Arcana check reveals: "Gnolls see your whole *world* as a meal. This Voice is acting as a leash, but it won't hold them for long."

**Player Choices:**
- Exert mental power to command the Flind to leave (Wisdom DC 10)
- Dominate her mind and order her to feast on other gnolls (Wisdom DC 15)
- Sever the connection and prepare to fight

**Consequences:**
- Successful domination turns the Flind against her own pack
- Failed attempts result in psychic backlash damage
- The Flind can be turned into an ally against the other gnolls
- This demonstrates the tadpole's potential for mind control

This encounter showcases the power of the illithid tadpole and foreshadows the player's growing psionic abilities.
