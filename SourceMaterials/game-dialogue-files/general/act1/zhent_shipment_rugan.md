# Rugan - Zhentarim Agent

**Source:** `PLA_ZhentShipment_Agent_001.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (combat/post-combat states)

---

Rugan is a veteran Zhentarim mercenary found trapped in a cave with his partner Olly, besieged by gnolls. He's tough, pragmatic, and above all a survivor.

When the player saves them from the gnolls, Rugan expresses relief and gratitude: "By the gods, you're a sweet sight." He explains their caravan was attacked on the Risen Road - "Gnolls, goblins... *drow*. Risen Road's more dangerous than ever."

Rugan offers information and choices:
- **The hideout:** He invites the player to visit the Zhentarim hideout near Waukeen's Rest with the passphrase "little serpent, long shadow"
- **The cargo:** He's transporting a locked chest for "some rich tosser in Baldur's Gate" - valuable enough that Zhentarim agents died protecting it

The player can:
- Accept his invitation and return the cargo to Zarys
- Intimidate him into handing over the cargo
- Persuade him to sell the cargo themselves and split the profits
- Attack him for the goods

If the player recognizes "Tarenths" (Zhentarim currency), Rugan acknowledges: "You know who we are - very clever. Then you probably also know it's not smart to interfere with Zhent business."

An Intelligence (History) check reveals: "Tarenths are the currency of a merchant network called the Zhentarim. Led by the mysterious Pereghost of Darkhold, their dealings are far from scrupulous."
