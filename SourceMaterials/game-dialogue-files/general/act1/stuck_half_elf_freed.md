# Benryn and Miri's Ring

**Source:** `PLA_StuckHalfElf_Freed.html`
**Starting Node:** Various greeting nodes based on conditions

This dialogue occurs after freeing Benryn, who was trapped in the burning ruins at Waukeen's Rest. Having survived the fire, Benryn is desperate to know the fate of his wife, Miri.

The player can:
- Inform him about Miri's death (she died in the fire)
- Give him Miri's wedding ring if they found it
- Lie about her fate
- Take advantage of his grief

If the player gives him the ring, Benryn is deeply grateful. If they stole the gold from the building, companions may react. The conversation can take several turns based on whether the player shows compassion or callousness toward the grieving man.

Various companions interject based on party composition and player choices. When the player acts tactlessly toward the grieving widower, Gale offers diplomatic apologies on behalf of the offending party member.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Lae'zel's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Shadowheart's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Astarion's behalf, sir. His lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "That was a rather unimpressive display of pettiness, if you ask me."

**Astarion:** "You took the gold? I was rather hoping for the body..."
