# Vlaakith Portrait - Vandalism Opportunity

**Source:** `CRE_General_VlaakithPortrait.html`
**Starting Node:** 13 (Githyanki player) / 18 (non-Githyanki player)

---

The player can interact with a portrait of Queen Vlaakith in the Creche corridor. The portrait looks down on them as if they were an insect.

If Lae'zel is present, she describes Vlaakith with reverence: "Vlaakith herself. She is both the sun that blinds us and the void that contains us. Praise be."

The Narrator notes a small symbol in the corner of the painting that the player can't quite place.

## Options

**Study the subject's features:**
- Non-Githyanki players see that she looks different from other githyanki, with stark white skin stretched over sharp features giving her an otherworldly aspect
- Githyanki players see her face brimming with might and glory, her power and beauty beyond words

**Inspect the symbol more closely (History check):**
- DC 21 for non-Githyanki, DC 14 for Githyanki
- Success: The player recognizes it as a comet symbol related to Orpheus
- Githyanki players recall stories of a prince riding a comet like this one, realizing it's the symbol of Orpheus - a forgotten hero from tales of their youth
- If Lae'zel is on the Orpheus path, she says: "The sign of Orpheus. Centuries gone, yet his influence stretches across the planes. Blasphemy, to scrawl it here. And a colossal risk."
- If Lae'zel is NOT on the Orpheus path, she calls it blasphemy and wishes she could quarter the vandal herself

**Draw a new face onto the portrait (Dexterity check DC 16):**
- Success: The Narrator remarks on the player's "masterpiece" and notes she looks less regal now
  - Lae'zel reacts based on approval: Either "A wretched display. I thought you better than such juvenile antics" (higher approval) or "Pathetic and profane. You've the brain of a child" (lower approval)
  - Githyanki players feel "the prickle of transgression" wrestling with amusement, and Lae'zel threatens: "Kainyank! I should take your head for such blasphemy. But I'll save the pleasure for Vlaakith herself."
- Failure: The player slips mid-drawing and is caught by Youth Vis'kiir, who panics and tells them to leave so he can clean it off before anyone sees

**Leave:**
- Exit the dialogue
