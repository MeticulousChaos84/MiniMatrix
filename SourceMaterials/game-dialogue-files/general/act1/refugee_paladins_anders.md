# Anders and the False Paladins

**Source:** `PLA_Refugee_001_PostEA.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (based on quest state and Karlach relationship)

These "paladins" claim to serve Tyr, Lord of Justice, but they're actually cultists of Zariel. They've agreed to capture and kill Karlach, one of the origin characters who escaped from Avernus.

Anders, the leader of the group, puts on a convincing act as a wounded holy warrior. He claims:
- They are paladins of Tyr
- Karlach is a "devil" straight from the Nine Hells
- She slaughtered refugees, including an entire family
- They were gravely wounded fighting her

If the player has recruited Karlach or knows the truth, the conversation takes a different turn. Wyll may interject, recognizing the description: "One horn? Then you mean Karlach. Archdevil's bootlicker."

Anders asks the player to hunt Karlach and bring her head in exchange for the "Sword of Justice." He claims it carries Tyr's blessing.

The player can:
- Accept the hunt and kill Karlach
- See through the lie (Warlock Religion check reveals devils use cunning, not carnage)
- Challenge him to recite the "Creed of the Left Hand" (Paladin of Tyr option)
- Call him a liar and trigger combat

When caught in the lie, Anders drops his act: "First I was burned within an inch of my life, and now I'm stuck playing pantomime. I can't take it anymore."

He then reveals his true nature: "Karlach is going back to Avernus, and if she won't go quietly, she *dies*. It looks like I'll have to kill you first, which I quite look forward to. Bye-bye."
