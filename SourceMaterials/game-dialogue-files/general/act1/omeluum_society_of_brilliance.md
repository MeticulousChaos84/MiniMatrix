Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. Unlike other illithids, Omeluum was born with arcane magic that allowed it to resist its elder brain and escape.

## First Meeting

Omeluum greets the player telepathically, addressing them based on their race:
- Githyanki: "child of the stars"
- Astarion/Underdark races: "child of the dark"
- Others: "child of the sun"

Omeluum offers to examine the player's tadpole and attempt to suppress it. It requires Tongue of Madness mushrooms and Timmask Spores from the mysterious tower nearby.

## The Procedure

After drinking Omeluum's potion, the procedure backfires - the tadpole becomes stronger, unlocking new powers. Omeluum offers a Ring of Mind-Shielding as compensation to help calm the parasite.

When the player acquires the ring:

**Astarion:** "A pretty thing. And at least it offers us some protection from the tadpole."

**Gale:** "That could mean any number of things."

## Background

When asked how it escaped its colony, Omeluum explains its arcane magic was despised by its people but gave it strength to resist the elder brain. Every waking hour it pushed back against the dire hold until the moment its control shattered, then fled before the colony discovered its defection.
