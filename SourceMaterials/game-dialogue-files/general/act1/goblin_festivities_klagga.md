This goblin is wearing a pair of fancy breeches he stole off a dead dwarf. A dead dwarf that he's currently helping to cook, on a spit. The breeches have a poem inside that contains a clue the player might need to open a dungeon inside the goblin camp, but Klagga is unaware of this. He'd rather admire his own fashion sense and flirt than figure out what the poem means, and he can be convinced to sell it or give it away.

If the goblins have realized their beer was poisoned: "Some coward move, poisonin' our drink. But we'll get them, you'll see."

Otherwise, Klagga greets the player proudly:
- For drow: "Greetings, your most excellent drow-ness. What do you think of these breeches? Could be a new uniform."
- For others: "Enjoyin' the view? Lookin' tasty in these new breeches, ain't I?"

Player responses:
- Compliment: "They look quite fetching on you." Klagga: "Proper stylish, ain't they? Nicked 'em off this dwarf we're cookin'."
- Insult: "Tasty's not the word. Gruesome, maybe?" Klagga laughs it off: "Are you kiddin'? I look *fantastic*."

If the player has worg dung paint on their face: "An' I ain't takin' fashion advice from someone with worg-dung on their face."

For tiefling players: "An' I ain't takin' fashion advice from someone who 'as to cut tail-holes in their pants."

Klagga explains: "*Mebbe* they're a bit loose, but that's cuz I keep myself in shape. Not like that chunky dwarf I nicked 'em off."

When asked what happened to the dwarf: "That's him, on the spit! Plenty of him to go around once he's cooked."

For dwarf players: "Don't take it personal. If my mate Grikka was dead and I woz hungry, I'd eat 'im. Bet he'd taste real good, too."

About the dwarf's possessions: "Dunno. Woz already stripped down to his breeches when I got my hands on 'im. Had a coupla coins in the pockets and some daft poem. But that's all."

The poem is the key to opening the Selunite temple door in the goblin camp.
