Mol is a young woman in her early teens who runs as a crime boss and leader of the tiefling kids in the Grove's hideout. She reacts to the various ways the player has treated her kids so far, and if necessary, can return items to the player that her kids have stolen.

Opening line: "Well, look who's come to visit. My kids say you've been busy since you got here."

If the player has messed with Mol's kids, she confronts them about it:
- "Messing with our business, yeah?"
- "You took advantage of Mattis."
- "You let that adventurer hit Meli."
- "You scared the life out of little Silfy."
- "Now, you're going to pay for it."

Players can respond in several ways:
- Mock her: "You're about as intimidating as a flail snail in a salt mine."
- Try to leave: "I don't think I'll be paying for anything. Bye for now!"
- Persuade (DC 15): "You're right. I won't mess with any of your gang again. Promise."

Despite her youth, Mol is sharp, protective of her crew, and runs a tight operation.
