The party comes across a trio of goblins who've captured a gnome and have turned to tormenting him - they've tied him to a windmill and are watching him spin around. The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possibly using a cult symbol of authority as a way to convince the goblins if they have it.

Fezzerk is the leader of the goblins and does most of the talking. If the player is a drow, the goblins will be much more nervous and easier to intimidate. At times, the captive gnome Barcus Wroot pipes up from the windmill, loudly pleading or berating his captors.

For drow players, the scene opens with Fezzerk's face falling mid-sentence: "What've we got 'ere...? Oh."

Barcus Wroot cries from the spinning windmill: "Stop this thiiiing!" or if the mill is stopped: "Let me dowwwn!"

The narrator notes: "The goblin seems unsure whether to bow to you or attack."

Fezzerk nervously asks: "W-what do you want, or, I mean... what do you need?"

Players can demand an explanation or claim to be a True Soul. If they have already used their illithid power that day, the narrator notes: "The mark glows, but you feel nothing in response. Your illithid power is beyond reach until you rest."

Claiming True Soul status intimidates the goblins: "N-no, not questionin', True Soul! Never! We know our place..."
