# Ghustil Stornugoss - Creche Infirmary Doctor

**Source:** `CRE_GithInfirmary_Doctor.html`
**Starting Node:** 60 (first meeting) / 41 (return with "friend problem")

---

Ghustil Stornugoss is the githyanki doctor in Creche Y'llek's infirmary. She's conducting an autopsy on a mind flayer tadpole when the player arrives, dictating observations: "Vertical incision from pineal eye to end of notochord... Intestinal colouration consistent with samples 231 to 259."

## First Meeting

Without turning around, she addresses the player: "Do you have a question or are you just going to stand there gawking?"

If Lae'zel is present, she demands respect: "I am a Child of Gith, not discarded rat-flesh. Am I not due your respect?"

The Ghustil responds: "Perhaps, perhaps not. Let the istik with you speak, and I will decide what respect you are owed."

The player can have Lae'zel speak on their behalf, who explains: "We carry ghaik tadpoles, and have done so for countless days - yet we show no symptoms. We must enter the zaith'isk."

## The Zaith'isk

The Ghustil offers the zaith'isk as a cure: "Lie down on the zaith'isk, and your troubles will be over."

If the player refuses or asks questions, she becomes impatient: "Chk. If you aren't here for treatment, then get out of my infirmary."
