# Gith Boy Training Dialogue

**Source:** `CRE_YouthTraining_GithBoy.html`
**Starting Node:** 29 (healed) or 25 (attacked teacher)

This dialogue occurs with Youth Varrl, a githyanki boy being trained at the creche. The player can interact with him after either saving him from his teacher or performing a non-fatal stab.

If the boy is unharmed, he can be persuaded to tell the player about Orpheus - a figure of apparent importance to some githyanki - and can subsequently be convinced to give the player his copy of part of Chapter 2 of a relevant text.

If the player healed him while he was wounded, he'll thank them and note the contrast between their compassion and the ruthlessness his teacher constantly preaches: "He's always telling us how we have to be ruthless, that death is the only mercy we deliver. But you... You showed compassion, and kindness. You're just like - never mind."

Players can read his mind to discover he was thinking of Orpheus, or pursue various dialogue options. A githyanki player can deflect the gratitude by insisting it wasn't kindness but rather that Vlaakith needs every sword against the ghaik.
