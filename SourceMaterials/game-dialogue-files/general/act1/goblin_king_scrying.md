---

The goblin king is about to conduct a ceremony in which he speaks with a mind flayer's dead body. He is a hobgoblin on a power trip, but still devoted to his god The Absolute. Like most goblins, he's not greatly intelligent, but a cut above the rest.

Pronunciation notes:
- Dror Ragzlin = "Drawer RAGS-lin"
- Z'Rell = "Zuh-RELL"

When the player engages with Ragzlin, they will experience a brief vision of him with an elf - this is teasing Ketheric Thorm, a later antagonist. Ragzlin will say he's looking for a weapon - the player will realize via narrator or mindmeld with Shadowheart that this is the githyanki artifact that she has.

The scrying ceremony begins with goblin chanting: "*Shuugaan, a shuulkac. O taash okec dor.*"

Ragzlin commands: "I command you, corpse: speak! Reveal truth to the Absolute!"

On return visits:
- For drow: "Praise the Absolute! What you needing, drow?"
- For others: "What you needing now?"

Player can ask about the drow-goblin alliance: "Goblins and drow, working together. But why?"

Ragzlin explains: "The Absolute's got room for everyone long as you don't defy Her. And nobody's that stupid. If the Absolute says to take orders from a drow, then we toe the mark, no questions."

If the player mentions needing a healer, Ragzlin scoffs at Priestess Gut: "Well, let me know when you find one. Priestess Gut's better at causing pain than curing it."

If the player tells the truth about their tadpole, Ragzlin turns hostile: "You're no True Soul. You're a damned *heretic*. Boys! *Crush him.*"

Ragzlin will interrupt anyone who approaches during the ceremony with dismissive lines based on race:
- Tiefling: "Not the time for it, devil."
- Human: "No time for human nonsense."
- Female: "Not the time for it, woman."
- Generic: "Not the time for it, hear?"
