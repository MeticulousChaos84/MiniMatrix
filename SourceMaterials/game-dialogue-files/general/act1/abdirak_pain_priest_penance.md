# Abdirak - Pain Priest Penance Offering

**Source:** `GOB_PainPriest.html`
**Starting Node:** 9 (after companion failed penance) / various based on context

---

Father Abdirak is a young, charismatic follower of Loviatar, goddess who thrives on inflicting pain. He offers to help alleviate the player's suffering through "penance" - beating them with his instruments of worship.

## Initial Encounter

Abdirak is found indulging in private worship (self-flagellation). He explains the intimacies of pain and offers to help the player experience peace and serenity through his penance.

When the player considers accepting the penance:

**Astarion:** "I must see this. Don't you dare say no."

**Gale:** "Your hide, your choice. Not quite my cup of tea though."

## The Penance

If the player accepts, Abdirak asks them to choose their instrument:
- His bare hands
- A scourge
- A mace

The player must have enough HP to survive the beating. If they've been injured before arriving, Abdirak tells them to return when healed.

During the penance, Abdirak strikes the player multiple times. The player can make Performance checks to properly express their pain, pleasing Loviatar. Success grants her blessing.

If a companion previously attempted and failed the penance, Abdirak notes: "I fear your companion could not fully embrace my penance. But I understand. Pain is something that requires commitment."
