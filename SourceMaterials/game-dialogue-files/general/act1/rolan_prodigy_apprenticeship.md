**Starting Node:** 48

---

Rolan is a tiefling mage who has secured an apprenticeship with Lorroakan, a wizard in Baldur's Gate. He's frustrated about delays in reaching the city, either because the tieflings are staying to help at the Grove or because of general delays in leaving.

## The Conflict

If the tieflings are staying at the Grove, Rolan is furious and believes they're dooming themselves: "We should have left by now. Damnation... Instead we're just sitting here - practically begging to be attacked."

He blames his sister Lia for insisting on helping everyone: "We will end up fodder for some goblin's blade - all because Lia insists on helping every wounded foal we see."

## Lorroakan Discussion

When Rolan mentions his apprenticeship with Lorroakan, Gale recognizes the name:

**Gale:** "I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"

Rolan confirms Lorroakan is an accomplished wizard. Gale comments on his reputation:

**Gale:** "Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?"

If Rolan confirms, Gale requests an introduction:

**Gale:** "In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."

When questioned about his motives:

**Gale:** "Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."
