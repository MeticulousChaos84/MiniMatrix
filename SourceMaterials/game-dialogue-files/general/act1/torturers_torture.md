A disturbing scene in the Goblin Camp where Torturer Spike is tormenting a captured adventurer named Liam. The goblin is torturing the prisoner either to find out the location of the Emerald Grove or simply for sadistic pleasure.

**Synopsis:**
Spike is actively torturing Liam when the player arrives. The player can intervene in various ways - either to save the prisoner or to participate in the torture themselves. If Shadowheart is present, she offers tactical advice on how to handle the situation, drawing on her... specialized knowledge.

**Key Elements:**
- Spike: "C'mon. Scream. SCREAM OR BEG."
- The goblin needs information about the druid grove's location
- Shadowheart can advise that the goblin's technique is "sloppy" and will kill the prisoner too quickly
- Drow characters get special treatment - Spike defers to them
- Player can take over the torture or try to save Liam

**Player Approaches:**
- Offer to "take over" the torture (to get the goblin to leave)
- Assert authority as a True Soul
- Attack to save the prisoner
- Participate in the torture

**Shadowheart's Involvement:**
If present, Shadowheart whispers tactical advice: "Say we'll take over. His work is sloppy; he'll kill the prisoner too quickly." - showing her dark expertise in such matters.
