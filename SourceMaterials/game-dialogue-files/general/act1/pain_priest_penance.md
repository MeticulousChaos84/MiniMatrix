A scene at the Goblin Camp involving Abdirak, a priest of Loviatar (goddess of pain). He offers to administer "penance" through ritualistic pain, which is actually a blessing in Loviatar's faith where pain is considered a holy gift.

**Key Elements:**
- Abdirak is a human worshipper of Loviatar within the goblin camp
- He offers the player a chance to receive Loviatar's "blessing"
- The ritual involves choosing words to cry out while being struck
- Successfully enduring the pain grants Loviatar's Love buff

**The Ritual:**
- Abdirak asks the player to choose three words to cry out during the beating
- The player must succeed at Constitution checks to endure
- Correct word choices and successful endurance grant the blessing
- The buff provides bonuses when HP is low

**Player Choices:**
- Participate in the painful ritual
- Refuse the "blessing"
- Observe with fascination or disgust

This is a darkly humorous scene that allows players to engage with one of Faerun's more unconventional deities.
