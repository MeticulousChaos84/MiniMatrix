**Starting Node:** Various (based on quest state)

Zarys is the leader of the local Zhentarim outpost. She's professional, calculating, and doesn't suffer fools - but she recognizes talent when she sees it.

The conversation varies dramatically based on the player's history with the Zhentarim:
- **After returning cargo unopened:** She's pleased and offers the player future work in Baldur's Gate
- **After opening the cargo:** She's furious and orders her men to kill the player
- **After joining Zhentarim:** She welcomes them but reminds them there's work to do
- **If refusing the job:** She has no use for the player and dismisses them

Zarys explains the Zhentarim situation: they had a steady operation going until someone "kidnapped a duke right on our bloody doorstep." The Flaming Fist will want someone to blame, so they're packing up and leaving nothing behind.

The player can ask about:
- The Zhentarim organization
- Their missing cargo
- The explosives they're using to clear the hideout

Zarys offers a job to find her missing agents and their cargo, emphasizing: "Bring them back alive if you can. Failing that, get me that shipment. *Unopened.*"
