This dialogue occurs at the githyanki creche's upper guard checkpoint when the player is caught trespassing. The guards confront the player about being in restricted areas, leading to various outcomes based on player choices.

The guards are hostile and suspicious, questioning why the player is in areas they shouldn't be. Players can attempt to talk their way out, fight, or face the consequences of their trespassing. The dialogue includes approval changes for companions like Shadowheart and Lae'zel based on player choices, and even Astarion approval for certain responses.
