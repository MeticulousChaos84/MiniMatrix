# Derryth Bonecloak - The Dwarven Alchemist

**Source:** `UND_MyconidCircle_DwarvenAlchemist.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (based on Baelen's state)

---

Derryth Bonecloak is a dwarven alchemist camped in the Myconid Circle alongside her husband Baelen. She's sharp, practical, and deeply concerned about Baelen's deteriorating mental condition.

Derryth runs the expedition's alchemical work while Baelen does the mushroom hunting - or tries to. She's protective of him despite her frustration with his forgetfulness. Their shop, "Bonecloak's," is based in Baldur's Gate.

Key dialogue topics:
- **Baelen's Condition:** Derryth explains his memory loss and her attempts to find a cure
- **The Noblestalk:** She desperately wants this rare mushroom to brew a remedy for Baelen
- **Trade:** She sells alchemical supplies and Underdark goods
- **Their Business:** They're suppliers gathering rare Underdark materials

If the player brings the Noblestalk:
- Give it to Derryth for gold
- Give it to Baelen to restore his memory (which upsets Derryth who wanted to sell it)
- Keep it for themselves

Derryth's reactions vary based on Baelen's fate - she's devastated if he dies, and conflicted about the Noblestalk's use.
