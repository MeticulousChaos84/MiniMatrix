Sazza is a goblin captive held in a cage at the Druid's Grove. She's terrified and negotiating for her freedom like "a terrorist locked up and offering their interrogators an option to save their lives if they free her."

## The Negotiation

If freed and encountered later, Sazza is grateful: "Those teeth. Those 'orrible teeth... Take this. It's everything I've got. I won't try an' get ya killed again, promise."

When the player wants information, Sazza resists: "I tell ya anything, and my life ain't worth a rat's breakfast."

The player can intimidate her:
- Barbarian: "Tell me, or you'll be MY breakfast." (DC 5)
- Others: "Bad news for me. Good news for the spiders." (DC 5)

If successful, Sazza breaks: "No, I'll talk, I'll talk! What do ya wanna know?"

## Information

Sazza can reveal:
- What's in Priestess Gut's chapel: "She's got all kinds of booyahg. Sickly tastin' stuff - might make your limbs grow back, but it's as sour as a bugbear's widdle."
- Location of treasure
- How to reach the goblin camp

She offers to guide the player to the camp in exchange for her freedom.
