# Goblin Priest Branding Ceremony

**Source:** `GOB_GoblinPriest_Branding.html`
**Starting Node:** 11

---

A dark ritual scene in the Goblin Camp where Priestess Gut is branding True Souls with the Mark of the Absolute. The player can participate in this ceremony, choosing whether to receive the brand themselves or observe the process.

The ceremony involves magical branding that marks followers as True Souls - servants of the Absolute. The magic involved appears to be connected to the tadpole network in some way, as Gale observes the ease with which goblins submit to True Souls.

**Key Moments:**

- Priestess Gut performs the branding ritual on willing (or coerced) participants
- The player can choose to receive the brand, refuse, or simply observe
- If the player accepts the brand, there's a gruesome scene involving gutting the previous branded goblin
- The brand appears to grant some form of connection to the Absolute's network

**Player Choices:**
- Accept the branding and become marked
- Refuse the ceremony
- Observe without participating
