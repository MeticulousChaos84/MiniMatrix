# Zevlor - First Meeting at the Grove

**Source:** `DEN_TieflingLeader.html`
**Starting Node:** 74 (helped at gate) / 29 (stopped the fight) / 4 (goblin leaders defeated)

---

Zevlor thanks the player for helping at the gate but explains that visitors are not welcome in the grove. He explains that the druids are forcing everyone out because of the goblin attacks, and that they've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the rest of the world. When asked about the ritual, Zevlor explains the First Druid, Kagha, won't see him and asks the player if they would speak to her for him.

If Zevlor and Aradin were fighting when the player arrived, he also thanks them for stopping the situation from becoming worse.

For drow players, Zevlor notes his surprise at finding diplomacy from a drow: "The stories I was raised on don't equate drow with diplomacy - I'm glad to see they were baseless."

For Wyll: "The Blade of Frontiers. An honour, no matter the circumstance."

If the player agrees to speak to Kagha:

**Astarion:** "Really? We're messengers, now?"

**Gale:** "I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."

If the player declines to help:

**Astarion:** "Turning your back on those in need? Maybe we'll get along after all."

**Gale:** "We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"

## After Defeating the Goblin Leaders

A scout reports that the goblins' leadership has been decimated. Zevlor thanks the player and offers a collected reward from all the tieflings. The player can accept or refuse the coin.

Zevlor mentions Halsin has returned and invites the player to a celebration at their camp: "But perhaps we need not speak of farewells. We'll join your camp tonight to celebrate, if you'll have us."
