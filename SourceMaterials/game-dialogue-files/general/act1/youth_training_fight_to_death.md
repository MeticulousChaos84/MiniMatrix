Sa'varsh Kethk, the Creche training instructor, is beating a student named Youth Varrl who refuses to follow orders to kill his opponent in training. The player can intervene and offer to fight the boy themselves.

## The Setup

The teacher beats Varrl, demanding to know why he keeps hesitating. Varrl tries to defend himself by invoking Orpheus ("Killing each other like this, it's stupid! Orph-") before being silenced.

The teacher declares that Varrl must fight again, this time with daggers and to the death. He asks who wants to challenge this "snivelling is'tark."

If the player offers to fight the boy:

- Githyanki players are called interesting
- Non-Githyanki players are initially dismissed as weaklings, but the teacher reconsiders
- Lae'zel comments: "Lesser? A Crèche K'liir hatchling would not have dared defy an elder."

## The Fight

The player receives a dagger. When told to begin, Varrl drops his weapon and refuses, saying there has to be a better way.

The teacher orders the player to kill him and "put us all out of our misery."

**Player choices:**

**Kill him (Dark Urge option):** "End him! Shred him with a daggered dance!"

**Kill him (standard):** "The boy's naivety is pathetic. Kill him."
- The player stabs Varrl and he falls dead

**Refuse to kill:** "There's no honour in killing a defenceless boy." / "Seems a little murderous to me. I'll pass."
- The teacher kills Varrl himself, calling the player's refusal "another staggering display of incompetence"

**Make a non-fatal attack (Dexterity DC 16):**
- Success: The player avoids major organs and knocks him unconscious
- Failure: The player accidentally kills him

If the player kills the boy (intentionally or accidentally):

**Astarion:** "Well look at you, killer. I didn't know you had it in you."

Wyll also reacts if present: "By the good gods, such cruelty. Is your soul truly this sick?"
