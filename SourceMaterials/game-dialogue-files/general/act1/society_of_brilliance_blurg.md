# Blurg and Omeluum - Society of Brilliance

**Source:** `UND_MyconidCircle_SocietyOfBrilliance_Scholar.html`
**Starting Node:** 85 (initial greeting)

---

Blurg is a hobgoblin scholar and member of the Society of Brilliance - a group of intelligent "monster" races working to improve conditions in the Underdark. He's found refuge among the myconids, studying their peaceful society.

Blurg greets visitors warmly: "Ah, a visitor! You're a welcome sight." (Unless you're a duergar, then: "The duergar are back! Run, little mushrooms!")

Key dialogue topics:
- **Society of Brilliance:** Small group of scholars researching ways to bring peace to the Underdark
- **His Research:** Studying myconid society as a model for harmonious existence
- **The Tadpole:** When told about the parasite, Blurg calls his friend Omeluum

**Omeluum** is a renegade mind flayer - utterly unique in that it has broken free from the Elder Brain's control and seeks to help rather than harm. It offers to examine the player's tadpole.

Omeluum speaks telepathically: "*You were infected by an illithid tadpole? It's a miracle you're still intact!*"

The mind flayer offers to:
- Examine the tadpole
- Attempt experimental treatment
- Provide information about ceremorphosis

Lae'zel reacts violently to Omeluum's presence: "*Ghaik.* Your head will make a fine trophy for my queen!" But Omeluum understands: "*Please, hold. I understand your rage against my kin.*"
