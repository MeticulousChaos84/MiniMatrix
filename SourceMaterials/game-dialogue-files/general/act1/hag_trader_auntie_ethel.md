**Starting Node:** 81 (first meeting) or 46 (return visit)

Auntie Ethel appears to be a charmingly roguish old lady selling potions in the grove. She is actually a hag in disguise. The player can explain what happened with the tadpole and Ethel offers to meet them at her home in order to "help them." The player can also get poison from her for the goblin camp, but she asks them to do her a favour instead.

First meeting: "Ah, if it isn't the talk o' the camp? Thank goodness you came along when you - oh!"

Ethel immediately notices something wrong with the player - she can sense the tadpole. She also has special dialogue for Astarion, noting his unusual nature: "Interesting to see you strutting about in the sun. Ain't seen that before, and Auntie Ethel's seen her fair share. Still, you're looking a little *pasty*, love. I've just the thing to perk you up."

Her charm hides sinister intent. If the player tells her about the parasite (Astarion approves +1, Shadowheart disapproves -1), she'll offer to help at her home - the Riverside Teahouse, which is actually her lair.

She plays the kindly grandmother role well, expressing concern: "I must say, though - you're looking *mighty* peaky. Are you all right?"
