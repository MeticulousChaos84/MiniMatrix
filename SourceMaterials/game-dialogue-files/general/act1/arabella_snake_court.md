**Starting Node:** 182

Druids hold court to determine whether to imprison Arabella, a tiefling child, for stealing the Idol of Silvanus. Kagha threatens the child with her death viper. If the player fails to intervene, Arabella tries to run and is attacked by the snakes.

## The Scene

Arabella pleads: "Please. I'm sorry!"

Rath objects: "This is madness, Kagha. She's just a..."

Kagha interrupts: "A what, Rath? A thief? A poison? A threat?... I will imprison the devil. And I will cast out every stranger."

The Narrator notes: "*A death viper. A single drop of its poison could kill that child in a heartbeat.*"

## Player Intervention

Players can:
- Ask about the girl's actual crime
- Object that she's just a child
- Try to persuade Kagha to release her
- Attack to free Arabella

When the player considers backing down:

**Astarion:** "Don't be a coward. We could take them. We could kill them all."

When the player tries to defuse the situation peacefully:

**Gale:** "Good. Let's focus on the girl first. We can settle with the snake later."

When the player decides to attack:

**Astarion:** "Yes! Let's have some fun."

**Gale:** "Hold on! It's not too late to settle this without bloodshed."

## Outcomes

- Successfully persuade Kagha: Arabella goes free
- Attack the druids: Combat begins
- Fail to intervene in time: The viper attacks Arabella
