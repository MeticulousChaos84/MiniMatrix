# Sovereign Spaw - Myconid Circle

**Source:** `UND_MyconidSovereign.html`
**Starting Node:** 86

---

Sovereign Spaw leads the myconid circle in the Underdark. Myconids are part of a hive mind and communicate through telepathic visions and harmonies. The sovereign wants the player to eliminate the remaining duergar who attacked and killed their young.

## First Meeting

The player experiences hums, clicks, and harmonies that drift through them like an unknown language. Visions show duergar chopping fungal tendrils with axes.

The sovereign communicates: "the dark intruders broke our peace. they killed our young... we laid waste to many. others remain."

A threatening vision shows the player's lifeless body wrapped in tendrils.

## The Quest

The sovereign asks the player to cleanse "the Rot" - destroy the remaining duergar lakeward - promising a reward.

When offered the quest to kill the duergar:

**Astarion:** "I'm more than happy to kill this - whoever he is, but tell me there's something in it for us?"

**Gale:** "My, but this sovereign likes to delegate."

When the sovereign reveals the duergar should be completely destroyed:

**Astarion:** "I admit, I like this one's approach. A little genocidal, but effective."

**Gale:** "I suppose such wicked killers deserve wicked ends."

## Additional Information

The duergar attacked because they seek a gnome (Thulla) who is a guest of the circle.
