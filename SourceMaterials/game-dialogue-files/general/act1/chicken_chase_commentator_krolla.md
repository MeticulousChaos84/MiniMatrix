Krolla is a goblin commentator for the much-loved goblin sport of chicken-chasing, which involves chasing a chicken (or later, a much larger owlbear) through a set of posts to score a "chicken-strike." She's fanatically devoted to the sport and expects the same dedication from everyone. She'll invite the player to take part, but only if they make a bet.

If she's lost all her money to the player: "No more chicken chasin'. Seems like it's all about the money for *some*, and I ain't got any to bet."

If the crowd is distracted by the toast: "They done yammerin' on yet? Ain't chicken-chasin' without a bloody crowd."

If the player kills the chicken/ball during the game: "Oi! You're not meant to chase it to death. Now you owe me."

Players can respond:
- Deny responsibility: "I owe you nothing - I didn't kill it."
- Intimidate (DC 10): "The game's not over. Maybe you can be the next chicken."
- Barbarian roar intimidation

If intimidation fails: "First you ruin the game, then you start makin' *threats*? Right - lads!" (Combat begins)

If successful: "You're bloody mad, you are. Go on then - you're just ruinin' the game anyway."
