Non-critpath encounter where Barth, a human adventurer, accuses Meli, a tiefling child, of stealing a necklace from him. A tiefling guard may intervene if things get out of hand.

Character notes:
- Barth: Angry, but gruff and restrained
- Meli: Fearless, urging Barth on

The scene opens with Barth threatening the boy: "Only going to ask you one more time, boy. Hand over my locket."

Meli denies it: "I don't have your ugly locket. I've never even seen it before!"

Barth escalates: "Hand it over or I'll slap the teeth out of your head."

Player intervention options:
- If player has the locket: "Relax. The boy's good, but I'm better - here's your locket." This impresses Meli: "Not bad. Not even a little bit bad."
- Defend the child: "Don't you dare lay a finger on that child." Barth responds: "You threatening me?"
- Back down: "Forget it. I don't want any trouble." (Wyll -1, Karlach -1) Meli mocks: "And I thought *he* was a coward."

Successfully returning the locket leads to Barth thanking the player, then warning Meli to stay out of his pockets. Meli responds by sticking his tongue out and running off.
