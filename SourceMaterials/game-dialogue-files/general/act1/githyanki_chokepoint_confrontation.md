---

A tense confrontation with a githyanki patrol led by Kith'rak Voss at a strategic bridge. The githyanki are hunting for a "weapon" (the Astral Prism containing Orpheus) and stop the player for questioning.

**Synopsis:**
The party encounters githyanki warriors who have established a checkpoint at a bridge. Voss, their commander, interrogates anyone passing through to see if they know anything about the weapon he seeks. The interrogation can reveal the player's tadpole infection, resulting in immediate combat.

**Key Moments:**
- Voss: "You are unknown to me, kin. Are you straight from the creche, wandering *unbidden*?"
- Voss: "*Tsk'va!* You seek to impersonate us? To *spy* on us?"
- Voss: "We must not linger among such cattle. Even their warriors' blood shames our blades."

**For Githyanki Players:**
Special dialogue options allow true githyanki to respond appropriately:
- Assert independence: "I am no creche hatchling. Do not speak to me as one."
- Show deference and explain being lost
- Tell him about the parasite and ask for help (he'll order your execution)
- Confirm you're from the creche

**For Non-Githyanki:**
- Admit to not being gith (leads to combat)
- Attempt to impersonate a gith (Deception DC 15 or Performance DC 15)
- Refuse to explain traveling with "local vermin"

**Consequences:**
- Successful deception allows passage
- Revealing the tadpole results in execution order
- Combat triggers if deception fails or player attacks
- The "weapon" is the Astral Prism Shadowheart carries

**Lae'zel Connection:**
If Lae'zel is present, she can interact with her people, though the outcome depends on player choices.
