# Druid Apprentice Nettie

**Starting Node:** 2

---

This dialogue occurs when the player first meets Nettie, the druid apprentice in the Emerald Grove. The player approaches seeking help with their tadpole infection.

Nettie is in the inner sanctum and learns about the player's condition. She's concerned but pragmatic, understanding the severity of what a mind flayer parasite means. The conversation establishes Nettie's role as a healer-in-training and introduces the player to the druids' perspective on the infection.

The dialogue can lead to Nettie offering to help or directing the player to more information about Master Halsin, who has more expertise with such matters.
