The players approach the drow commander (Nightwarden Minthara) at the goblin camp, escorted by Sazza, a goblin who they rescued from a nearby druid grove. The drow is seeking that grove and upon learning its location from Sazza will prepare to raid it, demanding that the player help.

If Sazza recognizes that the player is a True Soul - a figure of authority - her life will be spared. If she does not recognize this, the drow will execute her unless the player intervenes on her behalf.

The scene opens with Sazza's introduction: "Mistress! It's me, yer loyal servant, Sazza. I'm back - an' I brought a friend."

Minthara notes if the player is a drow or duergar, asking where Sazza found them. Sazza reveals the grove's location: "They woz in some rickety druid grove! Mostly full of tieflin's, but them intruders you're after were hidin' out there!"

Minthara asks if Sazza dealt with the prey. Sazza admits: "Ah... well, the thing about that is... they sorta massacred us. But this mug helped me to escape. I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are."

Minthara reads the player's mind and discovers they're a True Soul: "Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul."

Sazza protests: "Nah. Can't be... they woz in the grove, hangin' around with the tieflin's."

Minthara explains: "Undercover, no doubt. Carrying out the Absolute's will. Oh, Sazza - you have made a *grave* error. And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one..."
