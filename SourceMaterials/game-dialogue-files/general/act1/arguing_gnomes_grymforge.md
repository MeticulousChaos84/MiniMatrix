Gnome slaves Laridda and Lunkbug are in a dire situation. Lunkbug's lover Beldron is trapped behind wreckage from a cave-in, and Laridda's lover Philomeen has run off with smokepowder that could blast him free - but using it could anger their duergar slavers.

## The Situation

Lunkbug pleads to herself: "Oh Beldron... I'm so sorry. I'll get you out of there. I promise."

The player can:
- Find Philomeen and get the smokepowder
- Report on Philomeen's fate
- Help blast open the cave-in

## Delivering News

If Philomeen tells the player to tell Laridda to move on:
"Move on? I gave her everything. And she has the gall to send you to break me?... Get us out of here. All of us. And hope for her sake her path never crosses mine again."

## Using Explosives

When considering using smokepowder to help:

**Astarion:** "Well, some explosives would certainly help us free Thulla's friends. They might even survive the blast."

**Gale:** "If we're to help Thulla, we'll have to breach that wall with explosives and hope the blast doesn't injure anyone. Or worse."

When deciding whether to use explosives:

**Astarion:** "High-powered explosives do sound fun, but must we waste them saving lives?"

**Gale:** "Let's give them a hand, shall we? Only decent course of action, if you ask me."
