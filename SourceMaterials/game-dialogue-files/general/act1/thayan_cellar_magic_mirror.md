# Thayan Cellar - Magic Mirror

The player finds a talking mirror guarding a door to its dead master's secret room. The mirror speaks in a sharp, cracked, broken voice with a jagged cadence. It challenges visitors with questions to determine friend or foe, activating a trap if they fail.

## First Encounter

The mirror demands: "Spea-k your name."

For Wizards (including Gale as player): The Narrator notes: "A magic mirror! You've read all about them, but never seen one up close before."

If the player knows the wizard's name from reading books:
- "Repeat the name from the book you read: 'Ilyn Toth'."

## The Test

The mirror evaluates based on appearance:
- For short races: "My master stands t-all and proud. You are not Ilyn Toth."
- For Underdark races: "I see you were shaped by d-arkness, not light. You are not Ilyn Toth."
- For vampires/invisible: "I cannot see you. M-aster? Speak."

The player can attempt to deceive the mirror:
- "ILYN. TOTH." (Performance DC 15)
- "I'm invisible - my enemies are close. I have to get in now." (Deception DC 10)

Failure: "A lie. An in-truder!" (Trap activates)

If the player admits they're not the master, the mirror proceeds to ask security questions about the master's work.
