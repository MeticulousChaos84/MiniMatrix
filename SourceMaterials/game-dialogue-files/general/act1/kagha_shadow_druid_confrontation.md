# Kagha - Shadow Druid Leader Confrontation

**Source:** `DEN_ShadowDruid_Leader.html`
**Starting Node:** 12 (drow player) / varies based on prior choices

---

The player speaks with Kagha after the snake court scene with Arabella. Various conversation paths depend on whether Arabella died or was saved. Kagha is revealed as a secret Shadow Druid who took back the Idol of Silvanus and is sealing the grove.

## Drow Player Introduction

Kagha sees the drow player as a sign or gift: "Who better to understand a watchful broodmother than a beloved child of Lolth?"

The player can respond:
- "I'm nothing like you - I don't kill children." (if Arabella died)
- "I don't make a habit of threatening children." (if Arabella was freed)
- "You protected your own without hesitation - my compliments."
- "I'd have killed the thief outright."
- "Please - we have nothing in common."

## Kagha's Philosophy

Kagha justifies her actions: "A viper bares her fangs defending her brood. Is it not her nature to strike at invaders?"

She explains: "I took back the Idol of Silvanus and the rite has resumed. We will seal the grove. Free from harm. Free of intruders."

If the player chooses to attack Kagha:

**Astarion:** "Finally. Let's have some fun."
