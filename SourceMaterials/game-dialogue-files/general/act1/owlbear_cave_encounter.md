# Owlbear - Cave Encounter

**Source:** `FOR_OwlBear.html`
**Starting Node:** 33 (without Speak with Animals) / 20 (return visit)

---

The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear - a large, predatory hybrid creature. In Speak with Animals dialogue, her voice is deep and threatening, the voice of a seasoned fighter. She's injured with a broken spear protruding from one eye socket but refuses to betray weakness. She's protecting her cub.

## The Encounter

The Narrator describes: "You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness."

The owlbear growls. The player can:

**Study the owlbear's behaviour (Animal Handling DC 15):**
- Success: "The owlbear's one good eye flicks away for a moment. You follow its glance... and see an owlbear cub."

**Hold out your palms to show no harm:**
- "The owlbear stares, then sharply inhales your scent."
- "It sits back, its eyes still fixed on you. A silent ultimatum... You can leave now, or step closer and die."

**Move toward the cub:**
- "A bloodthirsty screech erupts from the owlbear's throat." (Combat begins)

**Back away slowly:**
- "As you retreat, the owlbear lets out a short huff. The message is clear..."

## Aftermath

If the mother is killed but the cub survives, the player can decide the juvenile's fate. If spared, the cub may later be found at the goblin camp being used for sport.
