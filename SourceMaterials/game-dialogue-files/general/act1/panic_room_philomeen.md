# Philomeen - The Hidden Gnome

**Starting Node:** Various (based on discovery state)

Philomeen is a deep gnome hiding in a secret room in the Grymforge, clutching a barrel of smokepowder. She's terrified, traumatized, and ready to blow herself up rather than be recaptured by the duergar.

When discovered, Philomeen threatens: "One more step and I swear I'll set it off - kill everyone!" She's holding a torch dangerously close to the explosives.

The situation is extremely tense. Companions react immediately to the danger:

The player must defuse the situation carefully:
- **Calm Her Down:** Persuasion or calming words can get her to lower the torch
- **Intimidate:** Risk setting her off by being aggressive
- **Learn Her Story:** She escaped the slave pens and stole the smokepowder to ensure she couldn't be taken alive
- **Get the Powder:** The smokepowder is key to freeing Nere - or killing him

Philomeen reveals:
- The conditions in the slave pens are horrific
- The duergar plan to work the gnomes to death
- She'd rather die than go back
- Her lover Laridda is still trapped there

If talked down, Philomeen shares some of the smokepowder (to free Nere) or gives it all (risking his death from the explosion). She then flees to find safety.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "As an expert on the subject, my dear lady - I'd like to point out that blowing oneself up is never the solution."

**Astarion:** "Easy now, let's not do anything hilarious."

*Both companions react to the immediate danger of a suicidal gnome with explosives - Gale with wry self-awareness about his own Netherese orb, Astarion with dark humor masking genuine concern for his own skin*
