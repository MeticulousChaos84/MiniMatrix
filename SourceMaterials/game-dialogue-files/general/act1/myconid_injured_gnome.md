**Starting Node:** Various (based on cure state)

Thulla is a deep gnome who escaped from the duergar slavers at Grymforge and found refuge in the Myconid Circle. However, she's been poisoned by duergar toxins and is slowly dying.

When approached, Thulla is weak and delirious: "Help... poison... please..." She's barely able to speak, suffering from the effects of duergar venom.

The player can:
- **Cure Her:** Using an antitoxin, a medicine check, or certain spells
- **Learn About Grymforge:** Once healed, she provides valuable information about the duergar camp, the slave situation, and True Soul Nere
- **Help Her Escape:** She wants to get back to the surface and home

Thulla reveals crucial information:
- The duergar are excavating something important
- A True Soul named Nere is trapped behind rubble
- The gnome slaves are being worked to death
- There's a way to sabotage the operation

She's grateful to the player for saving her life and warns them about the dangers of the Grymforge. If cured, she becomes a potential ally in the fight against the duergar.
