# BOOOAL - Kuo-Toa False God Encounter

**Source:** `UND_KuoToaGod_SpeakWithBOOOAL.html`
**Starting Node:** 14

---

The player encounters kuo-toa worshipping BOOOAL, their "Lord of Murder." The kuo-toa are former mind flayer slaves who can manifest gods through sheer belief. BOOOAL is actually a murderous redcap capitalizing on their devotion.

## Initial Encounter

Pooldripp the Zealous leads the worship, and BOOOAL demands blood sacrifice. With a Nature check (DC 10), the player recognizes the kuo-toa's nature and that their god is fake.

The priest declares the player will be an offering for BOOOAL. Players with knowledge of the kuo-toa can expose the deception, causing BOOOAL's divine form to falter.

## Companion as Sacrifice

When BOOOAL demands a companion be sacrificed:

**Astarion:** "I want to wake up beside a handsome virgin every morning, but life doesn't give us what we want. Can we kill this 'god' now?"

**Gale:** "Tread carefully, now. Not even a god would survive sacrificing me."

If the player offers Astarion as sacrifice:

**Astarion:** "What? You're bowing to this gutter-throated idol?"

**Astarion:** "You wretched little worm. I'll show you murder worthy of a god!"

If the player offers Gale as sacrifice:

**Gale:** "Not treading carefully, then? Out with a bang it is."

## Outcomes

- Expose BOOOAL as a redcap and fight him
- Become BOOOAL's champion (sacrifice a companion)
- Attack the kuo-toa outright
