This dialogue has two versions: Speak with Animals (SwA) and non-SwA. In the non-SwA version, the squirrel communicates via squeaks or through the narrator. In the SwA version, the squirrel speaks like a human. She shouldn't sound like a Disney animal - she's serious about getting the player to leave, seeing them as a threat, but she's also cocky about it. She doesn't think she'll have any problem beating the player to a pulp.

Players encounter Timber the squirrel in the druid grove. From her perspective, they're encroaching on HER territory, and she wants them out. The dialogue opens with her demanding: "Get out!"

Players have several options:
- Ask what that was for
- Try to calm her down and claim friendship
- Ask what sort of creature she is (githyanki only)
- Kick her (requires Dexterity roll)
- Dark Urge specific response: "Last words I won't remember."

The squirrel is fiercely territorial: "You're trespassing. This is MY territory."

If the player attempts to kick the squirrel and succeeds multiple times, they can stomp it to death - which triggers a notable Astarion reaction about ruining his potential snack.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "No! What did you do?!"

**Astarion:** "Oh, it's everywhere. You ruined a perfectly good snack."

*These lines occur when the player successfully kills the squirrel - Astarion is shocked and annoyed that they've destroyed what he considered a perfectly good meal*
