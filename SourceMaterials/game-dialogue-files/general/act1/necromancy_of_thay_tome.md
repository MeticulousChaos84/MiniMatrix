# Necromancy of Thay - Dangerous Book

**Source:** `FOR_DangerousBook_Tome.html`
**Starting Node:** 35 (first interaction) / 8 (bound owner returns)

---

The player finds a powerful book on necromancy from the Red Wizards of Thay. The book radiates power and seems to call out to be opened. Once read, the book binds to whoever attempted to read it. Reading it exposes the player to strange whispers that grow stronger with each page, risking madness.

## First Interaction

When the player first examines the book, they can almost hear a voice promising the book will be theirs forever if they just open it.

When the player picks up the book:

**Astarion:** "That looks terribly heavy. Why don't you let me carry it for you?"

If the player tries to destroy the book:

**Gale:** "What are you doing? That's no way to treat a book!"

## Giving the Book Away

If the player refuses to give Astarion the book:

**Astarion:** "You can't be serious. Give it to me this instant!"

If the player gives Astarion the book:

**Astarion:** "Excellent."

After Astarion reads and closes the book (feeling himself getting pulled in):

**Astarion:** "Well. Quite the page turner. I'll get back to it when I have more time to focus."

## Reading the Book

The book requires the Dark Amethyst key to open. Once opened, the player must make Wisdom saves to safely read the pages. The glyphs shift and whisper, and ghostly voices probe and fight the reader's mind.

Successfully reading all pages grants power over life and death, but with consequences for disturbing the dead.
