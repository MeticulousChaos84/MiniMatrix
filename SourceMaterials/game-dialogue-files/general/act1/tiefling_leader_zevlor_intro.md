# Zevlor - Tiefling Leader Introduction

In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. He'll show a flash of anger and frustration at the start if the player struck him, but is pragmatic enough to calm himself once he realises you could be more help to him than harm.

Opening line: "Forgive that display. Aradin's a blowhard, but that's no cause for me to join him."

Zevlor introduces himself and thanks the player for their help at the gate. If the player is Wyll, he recognizes them as the Blade of Frontiers. For drow players, he's pleasantly surprised: "I wouldn't have looked to a drow for help, but I'm grateful all the same."

The conversation covers:
- The druids' hostile attitude toward the refugees
- The conflict between tieflings and druids
- The Rite of Thorns that will seal the grove
- Kagha's role in driving out the refugees

Zevlor asks the player to speak to the druids on behalf of the refugees: "We'd owe you a great debt. If we're forced to leave now, we won't make it to the city. You'll find the druids at the heart of the grove. Please - make them see sense."

Player choices:
- Agree to help: Companions react
- Decline to help: "Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems." (Astarion +2, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1)

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Really? We're messengers, now?"
*(Contemptuous reaction when player agrees to help the tieflings)*

**Astarion:** "Turning your back on the needy to save your own skin? Maybe we'll get along after all."
*(Pleased reaction when player refuses to help, spoken with mock shock then jolliness)*

**Gale:** "I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."
*(Encouraging player to help the tieflings)*

**Gale:** "We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"
*(Gently suggesting helping even when the player declined)*
