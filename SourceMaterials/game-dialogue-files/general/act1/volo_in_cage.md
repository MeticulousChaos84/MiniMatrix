A conversation with the famous bard Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm while he's imprisoned in a cage at the Goblin Camp. Volo is known throughout the Sword Coast for his travel guides and his tendency to get into trouble while researching them.

**Key Elements:**
- Volo is imprisoned and needs rescue
- He can provide information about the goblin camp
- The bard maintains his charming personality even while caged
- Rescuing him can lead to him joining the camp later (and offering eye surgery...)

**Volo's Situation:**
The goblins captured Volo, likely while he was "researching" them for one of his famous guides. Despite his predicament, Volo remains optimistic and talkative - perhaps too talkative for his own good.

**Player Options:**
- Promise to rescue him
- Ask for information about the camp
- Leave him to figure it out himself
- Mock his situation

Successfully freeing Volo leads to him appearing at the player's camp later, where he offers his unique brand of "help."
