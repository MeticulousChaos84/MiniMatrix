# Nightwarden Minthara - The Drow Commander

**Source:** `GOB_DrowCommander.html`
**Starting Node:** Continuation of three-way dialogue

---

This dialogue continues after Sazza introduces the player to Minthara. The drow commander threatens to execute Sazza for her failure, but the player can intervene. Minthara then reveals her plans to raid the druid grove and demands the player's assistance.

Sazza begs for her life after revealing the grove's location: "It's past the bridge, to the east! Big ol' gate, covered in ivy! Don't hurt me, mistress. Please!"

Minthara's response: "I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure."

Player choices for Sazza's fate:

**Lolth-sworn drow only:** "You only have to *look* at me to know I'm your superior, wretch." (Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Karlach -1)

**Keep quiet:** Sazza is executed, crying "You coulda told me who you woz!"

**Defend Sazza:** "She's telling the truth. She didn't know." (Astarion -1, Gale +1, Lae'zel -1, Wyll -1, Karlach +1)
- Minthara grudgingly spares her: "Silence, wretch. And remember - you owe your miserable life to this one."

**Insult Sazza:** "I explained everything to her. She's just too stupid to understand." (Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Karlach -1)

After resolving Sazza's fate, Minthara reveals her plans: "Through sheer luck, that pathetic worm has brought me the information I need. And it seems that the inhabitants of the grove trust you - we can use that against them."

Minthara's demand: "Return to the grove. When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me."

The narrator warns: "The fate of the grove's inhabitants hangs in the balance. Killing the drow here would spare them, but it might be better to face her warband at the grove itself, on familiar ground. On the other hand, participating in the slaughter as she asks may be the perfect way to earn her trust, and access to the cult's inner circle."

Player final choices:
- **Agree to help:** (Astarion +1, Gale -5, Wyll -5, Karlach -5)
- **Ask for payment:** (Same disapproval)
- **Refuse and attack:** "The Absolute has nothing to do with it. I'm here to kill you." (Gale +5, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +5, Karlach +5)
- **Lolth drow attack:** "Absolute be damned - Lolth is our goddess, and you are a heretic."
