# Gekh Coal - The Lone Duergar

Gekh Coal is a duergar scout hunting a runaway deep gnome slave who stole Sergeant Thrinn's Boots of Speed. He's gruff, vicious, and serves the Absolute.

When the player approaches, Gekh growls: "Too loud, sun-scum. Heard you stumbling. Can hear you *blinking*."

A Perception check reveals his Absolute brand. The conversation branches based on how the player handles him:

**If claiming to follow the Absolute:**
He accepts this if the player can prove their faith, either through successful Religion checks or showing their brand. He warns: "But spoil my hunt, and you're dead."

**About the hunt:**
Gekh explains: "Hunting. Slave ran away. Took Sergeant Thrinn's boots. Got to kill the slave and fetch back the leather, or the bosses in Moonrise'll have Thrinn's hide."

The gnome is hiding in a myconid circle, which has frustrated Gekh's efforts. The player can:
- Agree to help hunt the gnome (Wyll -1, Karlach -1)
- Refuse to help a slave-catcher (Karlach +1)
- Attack him for his vile occupation

If the player has already killed the myconids and taken the boots, Gekh is impressed: "Well look at that! Swift work - you could teach our slaves a thing or two."

He directs the player to take the boots to Sergeant Thrinn at the duergar camp across the Ebonlake for a reward.
