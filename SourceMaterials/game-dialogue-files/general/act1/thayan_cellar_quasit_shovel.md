# Shovel the Quasit - Thayan Cellar Summon

**Source:** `FOR_ThayanCellar_QuasitSummon.html`
**Starting Node:** 16 (first meeting) or 5 (return)

---

The quasit is a summon that has information about the Thayan cellar. She's a little shithead who loves nothing more than cutting people up and being an arsehole.

First meeting, Shovel is furious at being summoned: "Argh. Shit-piddling toe-rag. Never summon Shovel. Never feed Shovel. Now call Shovel?!"

An Arcana check (DC 10) allows the player to recognize her: "You recognise the tiny fiend - a quasit. Wicked creatures often used as familiars."

For sorcerer players, Shovel notices their magic and becomes afraid: "Eh? What is you? Why you smell like that? You... you smell of magic. Magic of thunder and pain... No magic, please! Is good servant. Very good!"

Players can exploit her fear by making grand spell-casting gestures, causing her to panic: "Ah! AHHH. NO. BAD MAGIC. SORRY. SORRRRY."

Shovel can provide information about:
- The mirror puzzle ("Balsam for wounds")
- Master Illy (the cellar's owner, who was obsessed with a particular book)
- Various secrets of the Thayan cellar

If the player has already opened the mirror, she references their previous conversation about using "balsam for wounds" as the password.
