# Karlach - First Encounter at the River

**Source:** `PLA_KarlachRecruitment_Karlach.html`
**Starting Node:** 193

---

The first meeting with Karlach, a tiefling barbarian who escaped from Avernus (the first layer of Hell). She's wounded, hiding from "paladins" of Zariel who are hunting her to drag her back to the hells.

**Synopsis:**
Karlach is fierce, defiant, and intense - but also friendly and grateful if the player helps. She's been in far worse situations than this and maintains her sense of humor despite her predicament. The dialogue begins with a stream separating the player and Karlach as she holds them at crossbow-point.

**Opening Lines (Character-Specific):**
- To Astarion: "Shifty fucker like you doesn't get a second warning, so no sudden movements."
- To Gale/Shadowheart: "Given how soft you look, I figure you spit fire and crap lightning, so no sudden movements."
- To Githyanki: "Haven't tangled with a gith before, but I hear you're tough. And disciplined. So let's make this quick."
- Default: "No sudden movements, or you're dead."

**Key Moments:**
- Karlach: "Hold up. One more step, and I put a bolt through your eye."
- Karlach: "You looking for me?"
- Karlach: "Hurt or not, I won't miss - lung, heart, arse or eye. Take your pick."
- Karlach: "I don't belong in hell any more than you do. But I was there."

**Player Approaches:**
- Offer to help with her wound
- Mention meeting the "paladins" hunting her
- Tell her you killed her hunters (if true)
- Threaten to take her head (combat)
- Various skill checks to convince her you're not a threat

**Her Story:**
Karlach was sold to Zariel by Gortash and spent years fighting in the Blood War. She escaped when the nautiloid crash provided opportunity. The "paladins" (actually Zariel's zealots) want to recapture her.

**Recruitment:**
If the player killed the hunters or convinces Karlach they mean no harm, she can be recruited. She offers to help deal with whoever sent the hunters after her (Gortash, though she doesn't know his name yet).
