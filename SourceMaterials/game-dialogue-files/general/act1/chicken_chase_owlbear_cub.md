# Owlbear Cub - Chicken Chase

**Source:** `GOB_ChickenChase_Owlbear.html`
**Starting Node:** 9, 12, 18, or 20

---

This owlbear has been captured by the goblins. It is a cub and has been tormented by the goblins. In this dialogue, the player can reassure it, guide it to safety, or encourage it to attack the goblins. If the player has convinced his captors to release him, they can invite him to their camp. The owlbear refuses - but will show up later on his own.

The dialogue varies based on context:
- Whether the player has Speak with Animals
- Whether the chicken chase game is active
- Whether the player has already met the cub

Without SwA, the narrator describes: "The cub breathes in shallow bursts, his chest heaving with the effort."

With SwA, the cub speaks in simple, emotional phrases:
- "Mother gone. Hungry!"
- "Hurt me! Run! Where?"
- "Go home. Cave. Mother!"
- "Go! Bite! *Bite*!"

The player can attempt Animal Handling (DC 10) to calm the cub. Success reveals: "You notice a shiver run through his feathered coat - fear, a desperate longing for the safety of his nest. But his mother is gone - taken. All that's left are these *creatures*."

Player choices during the chase:
- Guide cub to goalposts for safety (DC 15 or DC 10 for Druid/Ranger)
- Encourage cub to attack goblins (DC 15 or DC 10 for Barbarian)

Inviting the cub to camp (Gale +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1 or Karlach +1 depending on context):
- With SwA: "New home...? Maybe. Got to get away from here first."
- Without SwA: "The cub tilts his head. He's considering it. He runs away. Only time will tell if he'll reappear."
