Oskar Fevras is an artist captured by the Zhentarim and forced to paint against his will. He's dramatic, haughty, and deeply pretentious - but also genuinely terrified.

When the player approaches, Oskar's behavior depends on circumstances:
- **If Zhentarim are watching:** He nervously tries to get the player to buy him, promising his patron will reward them tenfold
- **If player helped with Rugan's cargo:** He may warn them it's a trap
- **After Brem's death:** He's freed but still dramatic about his ordeal

Oskar reveals he's torn between two loves: Lady Jannath (his wealthy patron and betrothed) and a first love from before his fame. He fled the engagement due to "complications."

Key dialogue options include:
- Agreeing to buy his freedom
- Demanding a portrait as payment
- Refusing to help and leaving him to his fate
- Using Insight or mind-reading to understand his fear

If freed, Oskar promises his patron will be "most grateful" and offers to paint the player's portrait - "one so grand that even blind Tyr himself will weep to see it."
