This dialogue involves Scratch, a dog found near his deceased master in the wilderness. The player can interact with this loyal hound who is guarding his fallen owner's body.

Scratch is a good boy who was serving as a courier dog before tragedy struck. He's confused and distressed by his master's death but can be befriended by the player. Through Speak with Animals or general animal handling, the player can communicate with him and potentially convince him to come to their camp.

The dialogue allows players to:
- Learn about what happened to his master
- Console the grieving dog
- Invite Scratch to join them at camp
- Leave him to guard his master

Scratch can become a camp companion, providing faithful companionship and even helping to find items.
