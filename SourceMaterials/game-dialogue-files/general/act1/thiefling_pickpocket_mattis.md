Non-critpath dialogue with Mattis, a tiefling merchant kid who's trying to distract the player while his partner/sister steals the player's belongings. He's an orphaned street rat who works for Mol (the boss kid in the hideout).

If the player previously ripped him off, Mattis is cold: "I don't talk to dead scabs, scab. Keep moving."

However, if the player returns his stolen ring with an apology, his attitude changes: "Huh. Don't think anyone's ever apologised for stealing my stuff before. You know what? We're square. I'll tell the others to leave you alone too."

The player can ask about "the others," but Mattis deflects: "Don't worry about it. Now, you wanna buy something this time?"

If asked why he's so forgiving, Mattis shows pragmatic wisdom beyond his years: "Well, grudges don't buy bread, and I gotta eat. Speaking of which, wanna trade?"

The kid runs a small trading operation and can become a merchant for the player if relations are good.
