# True Soul Nere - The Mutiny

**Source:** `UND_TheDrowNere_Mutiny.html`
**Starting Node:** 176 (cave-in cleared)

---

This explosive dialogue occurs immediately after clearing the cave-in and freeing True Soul Nere. He emerges furious, nearly dead from poisonous gas, and immediately murders a gnome slave to vent his rage.

Nere explodes: "*Finally.*" Then immediately attacks the gnomes: "Worthless slaves. Your incompetence has been my *ruin.* Nere. Does. Not. Fail." He kills the gnome Meerna and prepares to kill more.

The player can intervene:
- **"Stop! No more innocents will die today, Nere."** (Gale +1, Wyll +5, Karlach +5, Astarion -1)
- Claim True Soul status
- Demand revenge for the myconid sovereign
- Challenge him directly

This triggers a complex three-way confrontation:
- **Nere** and his loyal duergar followers
- **Elder Brithvar** and his mutinous mercenaries (who want their unpaid wages)
- **The Player** who must choose sides

If the player previously agreed to help Brithvar's mutiny, Nere senses it: "Ah - I see treachery at every turn. Not every duergar proves faithful to the Absolute."

Nere offers the player a chance to prove their faith by killing the mutineers. The player must choose:
- **Side with Nere** (triggers Oathbreaker for Paladins; Karlach -5)
- **Side with Brithvar and the mutineers** (Wyll +1, Karlach -1)
- **Fight everyone** (Nere, loyalists, AND mutineers all hostile)

Combat lines vary by class, with bards getting special options like: "In your eulogy, I'm going to call you a 'Twat-Soul'."
