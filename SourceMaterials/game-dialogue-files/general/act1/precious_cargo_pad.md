# Precious Cargo - Player Active Dialogue

**Source:** `PLA_PreciousCargo_PAD.html`
**Starting Node:** N/A (PAD - triggered by examining the chest)

---

This is a Player Active Dialogue (PAD) that triggers when you examine Zarys' missing shipment chest. Each origin character has their own internal monologue musing about what to do with the mysterious cargo.

The chest appears to contain something valuable - the Zhentarim's precious shipment. Players can choose to:
- Return it to Zarys for a reward
- Open it to see what's inside (risking her wrath)
- Keep it for themselves

Each origin character reflects on the situation based on their personality and background.

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale/Astarion spoken lines appear* (PAD files contain player-character-specific musings rather than companion interjections)
