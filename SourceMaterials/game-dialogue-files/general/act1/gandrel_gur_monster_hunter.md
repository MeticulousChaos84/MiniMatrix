Gandrel is a Gur monster hunter encountered outside the hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and experienced - like a younger General Iroh from Avatar. He's hunting a vampire spawn that needs to be brought to Baldur's Gate alive: Astarion.

## First Meeting

Gandrel greets the player with "Moonmaiden's light upon you" and warns them about the hag ahead. He mentions his quarry when asked - a vampire spawn on the run from its master in Baldur's Gate.

## With Astarion Present

When the player asks what Gandrel will do with the vampire:

**Astarion:** "Oh? And bring him where, exactly?"

Gandrel reveals he's to capture the vampire and bring him to Baldur's Gate where his people wait.

## Betraying Astarion

If the player tells Gandrel that Astarion is the vampire he seeks:

**Astarion:** "What?!"

Gandrel is shocked the vampire is standing in sunlight. If the player confirms the betrayal:

**Astarion:** "You idiot. What have you done?"

When combat initiates:

**Astarion:** "You treacherous little worm!"

## Alternatives

The player can:
- Protect Astarion by lying to Gandrel
- Kill Gandrel to protect Astarion
- Betray Astarion (causing him to attack the player)
- Avoid the conversation entirely
