Nettie leads the player into her laboratory and fetches a thorn. The player doesn't know it, but the thorn is a deadly poison. Nettie knows it's the only choice she has - the player could transform into a monster and kill everyone in the camp. She sees this as a kindness since the transformation is terrible, so she has a very "matter of fact nurse" tone about the whole thing before she scratches the player.

The scene opens with Nettie showing the player a dead drow on her table - one who had the same parasite and attacked the grove with goblins. She explains: "Tadpole crawled out of his head soon after."

Nettie reveals important information:
- Master Halsin studied these parasites and understands them better than she does
- He joined the adventurers on their expedition to find out what was happening
- This establishes Halsin as missing and potentially able to help

Once she's scratched the player, her tone softens - she plans to sit with them while they pass and make it as easy as possible. The player must convince her they're not a threat to get the antidote. She'll be slow to convince, hesitant to allow any risk to the camp.

If other party members are present, Nettie addresses them: "You don't have to be here for this."
