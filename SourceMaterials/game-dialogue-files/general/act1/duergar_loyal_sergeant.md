**Starting Node:** Various (based on quest state)

---

Sergeant Thrinn is the commanding officer at the Grymforge excavation site. She's loyal to Nere and the Absolute, overseeing the gnome slaves who are digging to free Nere from a cave-in.

Thrinn is practical and no-nonsense. She manages the slaves with an iron fist and expects results. Her primary concern is freeing True Soul Nere before he suffocates from the poisonous gas behind the rubble.

The player can:
- Learn about the excavation operation
- Ask about the trapped Nere
- Return the Boots of Speed stolen by the escaped gnome
- Discuss the duergar's service to the Absolute

If the player returns the boots, Thrinn rewards them and expresses her appreciation - these were her personal property, and the runaway slave made her look bad in front of her superiors.

Thrinn also provides information about Moonrise Towers and the Absolute's operations in the region if the player gains her trust.
