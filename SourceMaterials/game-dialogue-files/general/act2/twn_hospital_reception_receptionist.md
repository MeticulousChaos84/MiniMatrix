# Sister Sinda - Hospital Receptionist

**Source:** `TWN_Hospital_Reception_Receptionist.html`
**Starting Node:** 88

---

At the entrance to the House of Healing, Sister Sinda acts as a receptionist, directing patients to see the Surgeon. She continuously demands proof of illness before allowing anyone to pass.

She greets visitors: "Here to see the doctor? Are we poorly? Are we *desperately* poorly?"

If the player appears healthy, she dismisses them: "Not so well. But well enough to wait. Join the line, and you will be seen."

Players can try various approaches to gain access:
- Pretend to be ill (Performance check)
- Claim to be the doctor's new assistant (Deception check)
- Claim invisible wounds need treatment (Persuasion check)
- Dark Urge can claim "dark compulsions addle my mind" and be examined

Class-specific options include:
- Clerics can claim they've been "hired as a new healer"
- Wizards can claim expertise in "maladaptive necromantic malaise"
- Monks can claim to be spiritual advisors
- Warlocks can describe symptoms related to their patron
- Barbarians can simply roar at the injustice

If checks fail, Sister Sinda becomes hostile: "Such cruelty, such callousness. And in our time of need. *Away*."

If the player already has low HP, she immediately recognizes their poor condition: "Poorly, quite poorly indeed..." and grants immediate access.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion** (origin, using his vampiric appearance): "My dear lady - look at my complexion. I am at death's door."

Sister Sinda's shocked response: "As pale as a ghost. You must see the doctor *immediately*."

(When playing as Astarion, his pale vampire complexion automatically grants him access to see the Surgeon without any check required.)
