# Last Light Inn - Rolan's Lament

**Source:** `HAV_ProdigyLament_Rolan.html`
**Starting Node:** 52 (first meeting with kids) / 34 (after rescue from shadows)

---

## Overview

Rolan is the arrogant tiefling apprentice wizard whose siblings Cal and Lia were captured during the cultist ambush. Found drinking heavily at Last Light Inn, he blames himself for their capture - but also blames the player for convincing him to stay with the tieflings in Act 1 instead of fleeing to Baldur's Gate. Despite his bitterness, Rolan is the only reason the children and Alfira survived the ambush.

## First Encounter

Rolan is at the bar, demanding another drink from Ide (a tiefling child serving as bartender):

**Rolan**: "...There's another bottle of Arabellan Dry back there. Put it on the bar, then piss off and leave me alone."

**Ide**: "Jaheira said we should serve drinks, but that we shouldn't serve drunks."

**Rolan**: "Jaheira didn't save your ragged little tail from the cultists - I did."

## Player Approaches

**If player knows about the rescue** (from Alfira):

"Alfira told me you're the reason her and the kids escaped."
- Rolan: "Cute - maybe she'll write a ballad about me."

**If player knows siblings were taken**:

"I heard your siblings were taken by the cult."
- Rolan: "They were. And you should have been there to hear their screams when they were dragged away."

## Rolan's Accusation

Once Rolan recognizes the player:

**Rolan**: "Oh, it's *you*. I'd recognise that self-righteous tone anywhere."

"If you're here to save the day again, you're a little late this time."

When pressed for details:

**Rolan**: "Oh, sod off. I'm only here because you 'helped' me and my family."

"I was ready to cut and run back at the grove, but you had other ideas."

"Cal and Lia were taken in by your crap. You convinced them to play hero, and now they're gone."

## The Full Story

**If player asks where siblings are:**

"Do you know where they are?"
- Rolan: "Dead for all I know. Or in the cult's tower with the others who were taken."

## Player Response Options

**Heroic**: "Then it's my responsibility to bring them back."
- Approval: Gale +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Karlach +1, Halsin +1
- Disapproval: Astarion -1, Lae'zel -1, Minthara -1
- Rolan: "They're *my* responsibility."

**Promising**: "If they're alive, I'll rescue them."
- Same approval split
- Rolan still insists they're his responsibility

**Harsh**: "Stop whining and do something about it."
- Approval: Astarion +1, Shadowheart +1, Lae'zel +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Rolan: "Oh, I will."

**Cold**: "They're better off dead than in the cult's hands."
- Approval: Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Wyll -1, Gale -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Rolan: "Bullshit. If they're alive, I can save them."

**Apologetic**: "I'm sorry."
- Rolan: "Sorry won't bring them back."

## Class-Specific Options

**Cleric** (Good): "I sense your cup overflows with pain. Do not blame yourself, Rolan."
- Rolan: "Myself? No, you god-bothering idiot, I blame *you*."

**Cleric of Ilmater**: "You must not blame yourself, Rolan. You have suffered plenty already."
- Same angry response

**Sorcerer**: "Keep drinking like that and you won't be able to read your spellbook, wizard."
- Approval: All companions +1
- Rolan: "Oh, it's *you*. Don't you get tired of telling people how to live their lives?"

## After Rescue From Shadows

If the player saves Rolan from shadow creatures when he tries to rescue his siblings alone:

**Rolan**: "Yes, yes, you saved me from shadow-creatures. No need to gloat."

**"I am absolutely going to gloat - I saved your life."**
- Approval: All companions +1
- Rolan: "Well, I'm not here to grovel so piss off."

**"I came to check on you, that's all."**
- Rolan: "*I'm* fine. It's Cal and Lia who need help."

## After Siblings Die

If the player returns without saving Cal and Lia:

**Rolan**: "I can't find Cal and Lia. Tell me they're here... tell me you brought them back."

**"I saved as many as I could, but they didn't make it. I'm sorry."**
- Rolan: "How did you decide which ones to save, and which to leave behind?"

**"I wanted to save everyone, but couldn't."**
- Approval: All companions +1
- Rolan: "That's the same mistake I made when they were taken. It's not a mistake I'll make again."

**"Simple - you kept up, or you died."**
- Rolan: "You bastard! I should turn your blood to fire."
- Rolan: "We're done here. But if our paths cross in the city, keep your head down and keep walking, or there'll be trouble."

**"Carl and Liam? I don't think I know them."** (getting names wrong)
- Approval: Lae'zel +1, Astarion +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Shadowheart -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Rolan: "You bastard! I should turn your blood to fire."

## If All Prisoners Died

**Rolan**: "Something's on your mind - spit it out."

**"I'm sorry, Rolan - I couldn't save the prisoners at Moonrise. They're all dead."**
- Rolan: "Then it's done - I should have died with them."

## After Siblings Return

**Rolan**: "We need some time, if you don't mind."

*He wants to reconnect with his siblings privately.*

**After reunion:**
- "I've thanked you once already. Don't be greedy." (slight smile)

## During Alert State (After Spy Discovery)

**Rolan**: "We won't even have to go out into the shadows to die now that the cultists have found us."

**"Nobody else is dying. I'll deal with the cultists."**
- Rolan: "I'm sure they're cowering in their heavily fortified tower knowing you're on the way."

**"Scared? Maybe you should have surrendered when you had the chance."**
- Rolan: "I'd rather be torn limb from limb than give in to those bastards."

## After Nightsong Freed

**Rolan**: "What magic is powerful enough to pierce the curse like a blade through flesh? Incredible."

*His arrogance gives way to awe.*

"Something is happening in Moonrise - I can feel it from here. Gods."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene, but approves (+1) of promising to rescue the siblings and sorcerer-specific teasing.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene, but approves (+1) of harsh/cold responses and disapproves (-1) of heroic promises.*

*Note: Rolan's arc in Act 2 is one of guilt and anger. If the player convinced him to stay at the grove in Act 1, he now blames them for his siblings' capture. His eventual character growth in Act 3 depends heavily on whether Cal and Lia survive Moonrise.*
