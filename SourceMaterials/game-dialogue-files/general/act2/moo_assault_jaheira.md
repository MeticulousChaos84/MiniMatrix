Jaheira lead the harpers to Moonrise after Nightsong was freed. As the player arrives to Moonrise, she greets them and can follow the player for the assault, If she doesn't follow, she will still join combat and move into the tower, in which the player has another oppertunity to have her follow them to fight Ketheric. Once Ketheric flees she will move up to the roof to offer recruitment.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Jaheira:** "Onward. Let the words of Alaundo ring true."
- **Jaheira:** "As long as we hold this floor, the tower is ours. I'll stay here - ensure no one comes up or down without a scimitar welcome."
- **Jaheira:** "You're close now. A final audience with Ketheric Thorm awaits."
- **Jaheira:** "Keen eye. I suppose I could be persuaded."
- **Jaheira:** "Fair enough."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "I detect a hint of envy. Perhaps you'd like to be there for that finale."
- "Then consider yourself persuaded."
- "On second thought, it is rather vital that this floor remains secured."
