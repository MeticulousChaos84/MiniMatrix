**Starting Node:** 1

---

This Pop After Dialog plays after resolving the Nightsong situation in the Shadowfell. Each origin character has unique reactions based on the outcome.

**If Shadowheart killed Nightsong (with SH present):**

Origin characters react to the execution:

Astarion (origin): "Do you feel better now, Shadowheart? A little less tense?" followed by "At least Shar will be happy. Or whatever passes for 'happy' with her."

Gale (origin): "A cruel fate for such a wondrous being. Is there so little room for light in you, Shadowheart?" followed by "Shar is no doubt pleased. Though I'm not sure I care for the pleasures of such a goddess."

**If Nightsong was freed (with SH present):**

Astarion (origin): "She does seem like a powerful ally. I just hope she's powerful enough." followed by "With her free, Ketheric is exposed. We only have to strike."

Gale (origin): "An aasimar for an ally. I feel the odds shifting in our favour already." followed by "Ketheric has the wrath of the heavens upon him now. And no hope of resurrection."

**If Nightsong was sent to Moonrise (with SH present):**

Astarion (origin): "Well, she's Ketheric's now. Her fate's in his hands." followed by "Let's hope we backed the right horse. Or the right nightmare."

Gale (origin): "Rather ruthless of you to just hand her over like that." followed by "Let's hope she doesn't seek revenge. I don't fancy facing an aasimar's wrath."

**If player killed Nightsong (without SH present):**

Astarion (origin): "She's definitely immortal - no question about that." followed by "Should... should we kill her again?"

Gale (origin): "Her death will be temporary, but her anger... that will be permanent." followed by "When she resurrects, she'll have no interest in helping us."

**If Shadowheart killed Nightsong (as origin):**

Gale (origin after SH kills): "A cruel fate for such a wondrous being. Is there so little room for light in you, Shadowheart?"

Astarion (origin after SH kills): "Do you feel better now, Shadowheart? A little less tense?"
