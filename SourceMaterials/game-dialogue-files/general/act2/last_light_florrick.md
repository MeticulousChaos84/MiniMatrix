**Source:** `HAV_Florrick.html`
**Starting Node:** 15 (with Manip Vidor intro) / 70 (direct approach)

---

## Overview

Counsellor Florrick, rescued from Waukeen's Rest in Act 1, is now at Last Light Inn desperately trying to organize a rescue mission for Duke Ravengard. She's preparing to leave for Baldur's Gate to seek reinforcements, but first she needs to brief the player on the situation and introduce the key players involved in the fight against Moonrise.

## Opening Scene

The scene opens with Florrick discussing the Ancient Fist (Art) with Manip Vidor:

**Manip Vidor**: "He still won't speak - just keeps going with the bloody song."

**Florrick**: "Nothing of use on his person?"

**Manip Vidor**: "His original writ of duty - signed by Eltan himself. Fella must be one of the very first Flaming Fist."

**Florrick**: "He must know *something*. Let's not give up on him yet."

## Wyll's Recognition

If Wyll is in the party, there's an immediate recognition scene:

**Wyll**: "Florrick."

**Florrick** (if Wyll is in devil form): "Hells - I know that voice. Wyll? In Tymora's name, what happened to you?"

**Wyll**: "The Hells have had their vengeance - and I doubt they are done with me."

**Florrick**: "Ye gods, fate has no shortage of troubles to burden us with."

If Wyll is an avatar player:
**Florrick**: "Wyll? Gods, please, no. The Blade of Frontiers was supposed to be my secret weapon."

**Player Options for explaining Wyll's transformation:**

1. **"A devil deal gone horribly wrong."**
   - Approval: Astarion +1, Gale +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1, Halsin +1, Karlach +2
   - Florrick: "A devil deal? Have you lost your - hm, forget it. Your soul is your own for the dealing. Your father's? That's a different matter."

2. **"A story for another time and another place."**

3. **"It's my business, Florrick - not yours."**
   - Approval: All companions +1

## The Mission Brief

**Florrick**: "Gods, please, no. *You* were supposed to be my wildcard."

"I don't suppose you've found a way into the Towers?"

**If player hasn't visited Moonrise**: "Not yet."
- Florrick: "We're almost sure Duke Ravengard is held within the towers, but this curse presents a formidable obstacle."

**If player has visited**: "I have. But there was no sign of the duke."
- Florrick: "It's impressive that you reached Moonrise at all, even more impressive that you're alive to tell the tale. But it's not the tale I wanted to hear."

## The Ancient Fist

If player asks about the man in the cot:

**Florrick**: "Isobel cleared this place, and he just... appeared. We think he was staying at the inn when the curse fell - which means he's been trapped inside for a century."

"It beggars belief he's alive at all."

"Hopefully he'll come 'round. Tell us something useful about getting through the shadows. Right now he seems to have little more to him than a refrain from some song or other."

## Florrick's Plan

**Florrick**: "I'll be heading to Baldur's Gate to seek reinforcements."

"The Council sent a carrier pigeon with news that the city has been dealing with Absolutist attacks. The Steel Watch is holding strong."

"I'll request that Lord Gortash send some of them to aid in the fight against Moonrise. The curse won't harm them."

## Karlach's Reaction

**Karlach**: "Holy shit. That's my old boss - the guy who sold me to Zariel!"

*Note: This is Karlach's first learning that Gortash has risen to prominence in Baldur's Gate.*

## Wyll's Knowledge

**Wyll**: "Gortash, as in Enver Gortash? Last I knew, he was a minor player in city affairs."

**Florrick**: "A lot's changed since you left Baldur's Gate, Wyll. Gortash has gained considerable influence since then."

## About Gortash and the Steel Watch

**Player**: "What are the Steel Watch?"

**Florrick**: "The Steel Watch are the future of warfare. Gondian automatons that can be sent into battle without risking any lives - except those of our enemies."

"Lord Gortash had only completed work on the prototypes before Ravengard and I left for Elturel, but even they were formidable."

"With the Steel Watch at our backs, we could storm the tower whatever Ketheric throws at us, I'm sure of it."

**Baldurian/Wyll Avatar**: "*Lord* Gortash? I thought he was no more than a counsellor."
**Dark Urge**: "'Gortash'... That name... It's sickeningly familiar..."

## The Odds

**Florrick**: "I'll do my best but there's every chance I'll fall to the curse or the cult before I reach the city."

"Don't count on me, and assume no aid is coming. Work with Jaheira. That Harper's mind is as sharp as her blade. Follow her guidance."

*Note: If Jaheira is dead, she simply says "Don't count on me, assume no aid is coming."*

## Parting Words

**Florrick**: "Farewell. We'll meet again, gods willing."

After this conversation, Florrick leaves for Baldur's Gate. Her fate is determined by events in Act 3.

## Additional Options

**About Isobel**: "What can you tell me about Isobel?"
- Florrick: "Cleric of Selune - she's got a room upstairs if you want to meet her. Just don't interrupt her while she's doing whatever it is that keeps this place shadow-free."

**Confrontational**: "Are the Flaming Fist just going to stand around here?"
- Approval: All companions +1

**Refusing to help**: "I have no intention of heading there."
- Approval: Astarion +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Shadowheart -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Minthara -1, Halsin -1
- Florrick: "I understand. These cursed lands present a formidable obstacle."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of most helpful responses.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of dismissive responses but also of keeping Wyll's secret.*

**Karlach:** "Holy shit. That's my old boss - the guy who sold me to Zariel!" (upon hearing Gortash's name)

**Wyll:** Multiple lines:
- "Florrick." (greeting)
- "The Hells have had their vengeance - and I doubt they are done with me." (explaining transformation)
- "Gortash, as in Enver Gortash? Last I knew, he was a minor player in city affairs."

*Note: This scene is crucial for setting up Act 3's political situation. Florrick's trust in Gortash and the Steel Watch is deeply ironic given what players will eventually learn about him.*
