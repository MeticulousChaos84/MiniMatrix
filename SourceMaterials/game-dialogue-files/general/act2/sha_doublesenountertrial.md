# The Doubles Encounter Trial - Combat Prowess

**Source:** `SHA_DoublesEncounterTrial.html`
**Starting Node:** 26

This dialogue triggers when a player interacts with the statue to begin the double combat trial in the Shar temple. The statue holds a bowl containing an ancient, rust-colored bloodstain - spilled calmly and willingly by past initiates.

If Shadowheart is present and recognizes this as one of Lady Shar's trials, she requests to perform the blood offering herself. The player can:

- Allow Shadowheart to proceed (+5 approval)
- Refuse her request (-1 approval, varying responses based on her approval level)

If allowed, Shadowheart produces a dagger and cuts her hand to offer blood. If refused, she either expresses disappointment at the lack of shared respect (high approval) or threatens the player might learn from their death (low approval).

The player can also:
- Look upon the statue to hear Shar's voice: "Vanquish your old life to receive my wisdom"
- Offer their own blood (Shar worshippers get special text)

This trial tests combat prowess - the player will face shadow duplicates of themselves.
