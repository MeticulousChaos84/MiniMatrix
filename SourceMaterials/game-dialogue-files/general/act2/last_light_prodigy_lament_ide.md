## Overview

Ide is one of the tiefling children serving as bartender at Last Light Inn. This dialogue follows the player's interaction with Rolan where he berated Ide for refusing to serve him more alcohol. Ide has a magic book she was planning to give Rolan as a gift, which the player can acquire. The dialogue shows Ide's hurt feelings about Rolan's behavior while also revealing her good intentions.

## First Meeting (After Rolan Snaps)

**Ide**: "If this is about Rolan, go *away.*"

*She's upset, avoiding eye contact.*

## Player Approaches

**"I'm sorry he was mean."**
- Ide: "He acts like he wished we weren't here - like he wished he hadn't saved us."

**"Ignore Rolan. He's just a grump."**
- Ide: "He called me a 'ragged little devil'."

**"No need to snap at me."**
- Ide: "...Sorry. Rolan snapped too and I didn't like it."

## Responding to Ide's Hurt

**"But he *did* save you - that's what matters."**
- Ide: "And now we're just trying to save him from drinking himself stupid!"

**"Ignore him - he's more immature than you are."**
- Approval: All companions +1
- Ide: "Right? He went through three bottles before I told him to stop."

**"All this whining is making *me* wish he hadn't saved you."**
- Ide: "You badger's backside-looking idiot."
- Ide: "You're just as mean as the rest of 'em."

**"True. But I don't think he meant it."** (about being called a ragged devil)
- Ide: "Then he should say sorry - all I did was tell him he shouldn't drink anymore."

**"Very observant of him - that's exactly what you are."**
- Approval: Astarion +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Lae'zel -1, Gale -1, Shadowheart -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Ide: "Yeah, well everyone says you smell like rotting badger, but they're wrong."
- Ide: "You smell like crusty toe-jam - look it too. *Bye.*"

**"Next time, call him one back."**
- Approval: All companions +1
- Ide: "I will too!"

## Rolan's Reasoning

**"Rolan isn't very good with kids."**
- Ide: "He isn't very good with *anyone.* He yelled at me just because I told him not to drink anymore."

**"I don't blame him - he wanted a drink, and you wouldn't serve him."**
- Ide: "It was for his own good! He can barely stand up straight."

**"Which he shouldn't have done."**
- Ide goes through three bottles comment

## The Magic Book

After the player shows understanding:

**Ide**: "Anyway, it's his loss."

**"What do you mean, his loss?"**
- Ide: "I found this book. Old, dusty, full of strange lettering. Pretty sure it's magic."
- Ide: "I was gonna give it to Rolan so he could learn new spells, you know? Beats drinking 'til he forgets the ones he knows."

## Acquiring the Book

**"Can I have it?"**
- Ide: "It's for *Rolan.*"

**"If you give it to me, I'll make sure he gets it."** (Deception DC 14)
- Approval: Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1, Astarion +1, Gale +1
- Disapproval: Karlach -1, Wyll -1, Halsin -1
- Success: Ide reluctantly hands it over (or realizes she dropped it)

- Approval: Astarion +1, Shadowheart +1, Lae'zel +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Success: Ide: "Sorry. I didn't mean - here. Just go away!"
- Failure: Ide: "Brat? Really? You can do better than that."

**"Do you really want to give it to him after how he acted?"** (Persuasion DC 14)
- Approval: All companions +1, including Jaheira
- Success: Ide: "Guess you can have it then. I don't care." (she clearly does care)
- Failure: Ide: "True. Guess I'll keep it then."

**"Why don't you keep it for yourself?"**
- Ide: "Hmm. Maybe."

**"That's a great gift. I'm sure he'll love it."**
- Ide: "Maybe. Thanks for... talking and stuff."

## Other Dialogue Options

**"A drunk wizard's a dangerous thing - all that uncontrolled power."**
- Ide: "Right? He might wave his arms wrong and burn the whole inn down, or belch up a puddle of acid."

**"He'll be losing his mind and his lunch if he keeps drinking like that."**
- Ide: "Darn shame too."

**"Stop interfering. Just stay out of his way - and mine."**
- Ide: "Fine. I *will.*"

## Alert State (After Spy Discovery)

**Ide**: "They took Mol - I couldn't stop them."

**"I could use some supplies, if you've still got any."**
- Ide: "Maybe."
- *Opens trade*

**If player promised to save Mol**: "What are you doing? You gotta get *Mol.* Don't make me regret trusting you with this."

## After Nightsong Freed

**Ide**: "People just ran off and said nothing! Adults always do this."

*On return*: "I'll find out what's going on *myself*, thank you very much."

## Return Visit

**Ide**: "Eh? You forget something?"

**"You mentioned you had a magic book?"** (if already discussed)
- Ide: "The one for Rolan? What about it?"

**"Nothing important - I just want a drink."**
- Ide: "My mum always said a drink's the most important meal of the day. Take your pick."
