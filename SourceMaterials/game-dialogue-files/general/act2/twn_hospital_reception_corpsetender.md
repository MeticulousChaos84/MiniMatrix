# Sister Lidwin - The Corpse Tender

**Starting Node:** 46

---

In the children's ward of the House of Healing, Sister Lidwin tends to a corpse - one of the Surgeon's "failed patients." She is in complete denial about the patient's condition, insisting they are merely "medicated" and will recover.

She initially mistakes the player for the doctor: "Don't call the doctor yet! I've got potions, sutures - I know I can do this..."

Noticing the player, she redirects them: "Oh, you're a patient. This is the children's ward - triage is back that way."

When questioned about treating a dead body, she defensively replies: "Not dead, merely medicated. To ease the pain."

If the player points out the smell, she insists: "The patient is asleep. The sedative is quite strong, you see."

Players can:
- Give the corpse a subtle poke (Sleight of Hand DC 14) to make the nurse think the patient is "waking up"
- Use class-specific Deception checks to convince her the patient is stable (Cleric, Monk, Druid options)
- Simply tell her the truth (which she rejects)

Once convinced the patient is "recovering," Sister Lidwin will trade medical supplies with the player.

If the Surgeon is already dead, she mutters: "The doctor's found oblivion... well. No time to mourn. I'll fix this without him."

The corpse can be either of Arabella's parents, depending on game state.
