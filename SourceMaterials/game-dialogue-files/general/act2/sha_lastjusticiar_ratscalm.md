# The Temple Rats - Strange Behavior

By talking to the rats in the Shar Temple with Speak with Animals, the player discovers they exhibit strange, specific behavioral patterns. The rats are aggressive, territorial, and speak cryptically - they are actually fragments of a Dark Justiciar's consciousness split apart.

The rats hiss things like:
- "Unworthy of dark cloak! Unworthy of dark fur! UNWORTHY!"
- "This is the path of heroes! Your feet sully it."
- "We outnumber you, leave me be!"
- "Two legs. Too familiar."
- "Join an army. Became an army. LEAVE!"

Players can:
- Ask why the place is important to them - they claim they've "always been here" and watch over it
- Threaten them - they respond "We are small, but many. Leave, or see what happens."
- Study their behavior (DC 14 Animal Handling) - the rat seems "defiant"
- Consider their tone (DC 14 Insight) - they're proud, not just territorial
- Study their ki as a Monk (DC 16 Insight) - their ki is "frenetic and powerful"

After multiple interactions, companions comment on the strangeness. If the player passes checks, they notice something odd about these rats that hints at the bigger mystery - that they share the consciousness of Lyrthindor, the last Dark Justiciar.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "As rats go, this one seems to be somewhat of an eccentric." (random inclusion)

**Gale:** "Extraordinary behaviour. There's more to these rats than meets their beady little eyes." (after rat threatens)

**Gale:** "Defiant little fellow. Seems oddly... purposeful." (after rat refuses to back down)

**Astarion:** "Strange little beast. I would've made short work of it, once." (random inclusion)

**Astarion:** "You're being held up by a snack. Leave the rodent and let's look around." (after rat refuses cooperation)

**Astarion:** "Are you really being waylaid by a snack? Let's just look around, vermin be damned." (suggesting moving on)
