This conversation features: Shadowheart, Narrator.

The player discovers an altar in the temple of Shar. They can choose to pray at it, with the chance to receive a buff or debuff depending on the outcome of a religion check. Shar and Selune tags automatically get buff and debuff respectively. Avatar Shadowheart gets a unique and ambigous outcome, casting some doubt on her standing with her goddess.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Narrator:** "*A small prickle of dread finds your heart as you look upon the altar.*"
- **Narrator:** "*A contented emptiness washes over you as you gaze upon the altar.*"
- **Narrator:** "*A flicker of anxiety comes to you as you look upon the altar. Why was it so difficult to receive Shar's blessing...?*"
- **Shadowheart:** "A place of offering to the Dark Lady. May she embrace the entire world."
- **Shadowheart:** "Such a noble shrine. I fail to understand why some speak ill of Shar. She radiates grace."

**Sample Player Choices:**

- "Bow your head and listen for Shar's presence."
- "Shar is not your mistress, but she is worthy of respect. Offer her a prayer."
