This conversation features: Barcus Wroot.

The unfortunate gnome is playing with his powders, his mood downcast and face smeared with soot. He's learnt that the gnomes are at Moonrise. He'll ask us again to help them if we haven't agreed already. He has nodes to cover alternate states in HAV, but not as many as e.g. harpers. He is mostly concerned with Wulbren, and other matters are of little import to him.This dialogue will be expanded when we have clear messaging around what happened to the gnomes in HAV and how Barcus should react to them.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Barcus Wroot:** "There's something in the air. I don't like it."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "I don't know. I can't help but feel that something's... especially wrong. I mustn't let my imagination run away with me, though."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "Yes?"
- **Barcus Wroot:** "Where in the world did everyone go? Quite the fuss, but I'm not sure why. You'll - you'll follow up, keep things in hand, won't you? Of course you will."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "Go on, then. No one but hang-abouts and n'er-do-muches here. And myself, of course."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "Could be the evil curse surrounding us."
- "Leave."
- "Is the Brilliant Retort ready?"
