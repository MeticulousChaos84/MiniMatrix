**Starting Node:** 71 (standard) / 79 (if spoke on roof) / 31 (Isobel killed)

## Overview

This dialogue begins the Ketheric boss fight in the Colony. The scene has multiple variations depending on whether the Nightsong is alive or dead, Isobel's fate, and whether the player previously spoke to Ketheric on the Moonrise roof. Ketheric reveals his motivations - his devotion to Myrkul in exchange for Isobel's resurrection.

## Standard Opening

**Ketheric**: "There you are. As predicted. What is it, I wonder, that draws one toward death like a moth to light?"

"You could have run away. Absconded with the Prism - the one thing that could prevent me from fulfilling my destiny."

"But the lure of one's destiny is irresistible, isn't it?"

"Perhaps you hoped to learn your place in history before you are erased from it. A bright flash of clarity before the snuffing-out."

## Alternative Openings

**If player spoke to Ketheric on the roof**: "You - what in the name of the Nine Hells are you doing here?!" followed by "Balthazar - I should have expected his weakness."

**If player killed Isobel in the Colony**: "You. After all you've done, after all your trifling, you dare strike at my daughter?!" He threatens: "What a fool you are. I am death. She is mine. She will return - always return."

## Origin-Specific Responses

Players can assert their own destinies:

**Astarion**: "I know my destiny - he's waiting in Baldur's Gate. And you're standing in my way, old man."

**Lae'zel**: "I am not intimidated by the likes of you. I will gain my queen's favour and ascend." OR "The liberation of my people may be close at hand. And I will stop at nothing to see it done."

**Shadowheart** (Shar path): "My place is right here - ready to strike you down in Lady Shar's name."
**Shadowheart** (other): "My place is in Baldur's Gate. Yours is in a grave - permanently, this time."

**Gale**: "Funny you say that. My place is right here, and my 'bright flash' could be the last thing you see..."

**Wyll**: "Damned wretch. I will liberate my father from your rotten hands."

**Karlach**: "Neither you nor your pal Gortash know the first thing about my 'place'."

**Halsin**: "I am right where I need to be - ready to vanquish you and your curse, forever."

**Jaheira**: "I sense you ask questions only to hear yourself answer them - so by all means, tell me my place."

**Minthara**: "My place is standing over you, with my boot on your throat."

**Dark Urge**: "I will find out who I was, and end my killing fate." OR "I will reach my own crimson castle, and your corpse will pave my path."

To Dark Urge's boast, Ketheric replies: "A mad dog like Orin might be impressed. I am not."

## Ketheric's Motivation

No matter the response, Ketheric reveals his true motivation:

"That is the power my Lord Myrkul has granted me - command over the immeasurable legions of the dead."

"But he did not only give me power - he gave me the one thing no other god could grant me."

"My daughter's life returned. Her heart beating once more."

"For that, he asked that I serve as his Chosen, join Orin and Gortash to grow the cult of the Absolute, and then... take control of it."

"He's never had a more devoted follower."

"I have fought great wars before, in the service of other gods, and other powers. But for Myrkul, I would condemn all of Faerûn to death."

## Class-Specific Options

**Clerics/Paladins of Myrkul**: "My place is at the Lord of Bones' side, like yours."
- Ketheric: "All mortals find their place at our Lord's side in time - your time is now."

**Clerics/Paladins of Bane**: "You have an alliance with the Black Hand, Bane. I am his servant. You ought to work with me."
- Ketheric: "A temptation or a threat? With your god, it's always the latter, isn't it? I only serve one god."

## The Mercy Option

If the player previously showed Ketheric the error of his ways on the roof, they can attempt:

**"I was ready to show you mercy before. It's still not too late. You can repent."** (Persuasion DC 18)

**Success**: Ketheric hesitates - "Repent? Would that even be possible? Perhaps..." This skips phase 1 of the boss fight, causing him to transform directly into his Apostle form.

**Failure**: "For a moment - a moment only - I was weak. No longer."

## Pre-Battle Lines

**Ketheric's ultimatum**: "I will kill you now. And then I will raise you as my servant."

If Isobel is present (tadpoled):
- **Ketheric**: "Say farewell, Isobel."
- **Isobel**: "I'm grateful to you for bringing me home. I was a fool to resist. I know better now."
- **Isobel**: "Good luck in the City of Judgement. I wish you the best, sincerely."

If Nightsong is freed and Isobel is present:
- **Nightsong**: "Isobel - my love, what has happened to you?"
- **Isobel**: "In your cage, Aylin."
- **Nightsong**: "You are no True Soul - you are a champion. Kill the madman. I fight at your side."

**Ketheric's prayer**: "My Lord, I offer you these souls so they may return as servants to your cause."

"Join the army of the dead, True Soul. Witness Lord Myrkul's glory!"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** (if origin) "Funny you say that. My place is right here, and my 'bright flash' could be the last thing you see..."

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene, but the Astarion origin line implies his focus on Cazador.*

*Note: This scene primarily features Ketheric's monologue and origin-specific player responses. The companion interjections are limited to origin player lines.*
