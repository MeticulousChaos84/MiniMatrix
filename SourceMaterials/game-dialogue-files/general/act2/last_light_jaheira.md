*Note: Jaheira's default dialogue is a treasure trove of Forgotten Realms lore, particularly regarding her storied past as a companion to Gorion's Ward (the protagonist of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2). She provides essential tactical information while also offering philosophical insights about leadership, sacrifice, and the nature of heroism. Her dialogue changes significantly based on the player's actions and the state of the Shadow-Cursed Lands.*
