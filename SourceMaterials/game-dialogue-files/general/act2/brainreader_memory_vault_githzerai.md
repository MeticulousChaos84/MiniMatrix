## Overview

Deep within the Colony's lower level lies a Memory Library with a Brain Reading Device. One of the preserved brains contains the consciousness of a githzerai monk - a sibling race to the githyanki, known for their psionic mastery. Her mind has survived centuries of imprisonment, but she desperately wants release.

## The Githzerai's Story

The slack-skinned head examines the player's features, guessing at their race. For non-githyanki characters, she offers a proposal: "Come now. You're as much a prisoner of this place as I. Let us aid one another."

**Passive Knowledge Checks:**
- **Intelligence (History) DC 18**: Learn that the githzerai are monk-like psionics experts, sibling race to githyanki. Both races share a burning hatred for the illithids.
- **Githyanki characters** automatically recognize the zerai as their bitter cousins.

## The Truth Behind Her Imprisonment

If the player passes a **Wisdom (Insight) DC 18** check (or has a Warlock patron warning), they catch that she's lying about something.

When pressed for the truth, she confesses: "The ghaik did not find my monastery. I led them there."

She betrayed her entire order for a promise of immortality. Instead, the illithids kept her as a "rotting trophy for centuries." The Narrator notes that to your tadpole, her guilt and terror are almost "fragrant" - the illithids locked her away as "a fine vintage."

## The Offer

She taught a psionic technique that the mind flayers feared. Now she offers: "Use your tadpole. Erase me - and I will pass my technique onto you."

**Player Choices:**

1. **"Reach out and consume her mind."** (ILLITHID required)
   - Approval: Astarion +1, Minthara +1
   - Disapproval: Lae'zel -1, Shadowheart -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Jaheira -1, Halsin -1
   - She screams "NO. PLEASE!" as you devour her consciousness. Brutal ending.

2. **"Reach out and purge her mind."** (ILLITHID required)
   - The awareness that floods you is "tentative, tinged with the loneliness of aeons"
   - She fades peacefully, leaving behind a fragment of knowledge
   - Her last words: "And I... I see..."
   - Approval: Gale +1, Wyll +1, Karlach +1
   - Disapproval: Lae'zel -1

3. **"I have no psionic power."** (No tadpole)
   - She laments: "A terrible fate, to be born without a high-mind"
   - Asks you to return with someone who has the gift

4. **"Leave."**
   - She pleads "PLEASE!" as you walk away

## Special Dialogues

**Githyanki Players**: Can mock her with "Why? This form fits you so much better, cousin." (Lae'zel +1, Karlach -1) She snaps back about how githyanki skulls would be too tight since they "shunned psionics."

**Players who don't know about Githzerai**: Can ask "Is that some kind of githyanki?" which earns Lae'zel's disapproval (-1) and a scathing response.
