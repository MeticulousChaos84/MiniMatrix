# Last Light Inn - Tadpole Checkpoint (Meeting Jaheira)

**Source:** `HAV_EnteringHaven_TadpoleCheckpoint.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (entry-dependent)

---

## Overview

This is the player's first major interaction with Jaheira, the legendary Harper druid. When entering Last Light Inn - whether openly, sneaking in, or with Harper escort - the player is routed to the barricade checkpoint where Jaheira tests them to see if they carry a tadpole. Upon discovering they do, she must be convinced to let them enter. This tense scene establishes Jaheira's cautious leadership style and introduces several key NPCs who may vouch for the player.

## Trigger Conditions

Various approaches lead to this scene:
- Entering Haven openly
- Sneaking in (and being caught)
- Arriving with or without Harper escort

All routes lead to the barricade checkpoint.

## The Tadpole Test

Jaheira uses a captive tadpole in a jar to test the player. When the jar nears the player's face, the tadpole lashes to life, straining toward them through the glass - confirming they carry a parasite.

**Jaheira**: "...it's that it knows its own kind."

## Explaining Control Over the Tadpole

The player must explain how they maintain control despite being infected:

**If player claims magical willpower:**
**Jaheira**: "I've met no sorcerer that powerful - and I've met many. Now, speak plain - *how do you have control?*"

**If player mentions special artifact:**
**Jaheira**: "Strangest magic I've seen since roaming the ruins of Myth Drannor, but I can't argue with the results."

**If player simply demands entry:**
**Jaheira**: "*Wizards...* Always talking, never knowing when to be quiet."

## Marcus May Vouch (Betrayal Setup)

If Marcus (the secret True Soul) vouches for the player at the gate, this sets up his later betrayal:

**Jaheira**: "Marcus? He's been with us from the beginning. Since..."
**Jaheira**: "...When *did* you join us, Marcus?"

*This subtle moment of doubt foreshadows Jaheira's later confrontation with Marcus.*

## Mol May Also Vouch

Mol can vouch for the player based on actions in Act 1, providing another path to entry.

## Key Jaheira Lines

**On recognizing hope:**
"I'll not pretend to understand why you, the enigma that you are, suddenly crossed our path, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark."

**On granting access:**
"Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt."
"Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!"

**On the Shadow Curse:**
"There's food in the inn over there. Beds too if you require rest. Aloe oil in the cupboard in case the vines gave you a rash."

## If Player Saved Emerald Grove

**Jaheira**: "She's/He's/They're the one who protected the Emerald Grove?"

**Jaheira**: "A True Soul with a mind of her/his/their own... How is that possible?"

## Antagonistic Responses

**If player threatens Jaheira:**
"You won't have to like them very long."

**If player claims to worship a god while being True Soul:**
"A pathetic deception - I know who you *really* worship, True Soul."

**If player tries to use Absolute powers:**
"I'm not interested in the Absolute's manipulations."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

*Note: This checkpoint scene is the player's introduction to Jaheira as a major NPC. Her caution - testing visitors with the tadpole jar, questioning them thoroughly, keeping archers at the ready - establishes both the danger of the situation and her competence as a leader. The scene also subtly plants seeds for Marcus's betrayal by having Jaheira briefly question when he joined the Harpers. Her mention of Myth Drannor references her long adventuring history spanning multiple games.*
