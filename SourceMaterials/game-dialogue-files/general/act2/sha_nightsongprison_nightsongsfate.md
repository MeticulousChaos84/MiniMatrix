# Nightsong's Fate - Solo Encounter

This is the player's encounter with Dame Aylin (the Nightsong) when Balthazar is already dead. Nightsong is an immortal aasimar and daughter of Selune who has been trapped in the Shadowfell for a century.

If the player betrayed Balthazar, Nightsong opens: "A valiant performance. I admit, my heart lit like a full moon when you struck down that cadaver."

She questions the player's motives: "But why betray your kinsman? Why turn your ire on he who sent you here? Go on, Sharran - speak."

Nightsong introduces herself: "I am Dame Aylin. Out of this hellish realm I carry my sword by the blessing of my mother, Selune."

When asked about her imprisonment: "A hundred years. More, perhaps. Concocted by Ketheric, enacted by Balthazar, my misery has been my centuries' long companion."

The player can reveal they're not a Sharran, and Nightsong will soften: "A Sharran with a heart? No... perhaps you are no Sharran at all."

Clerics of Selune get a special acknowledgment: "This cursed place is far from our Lady's favour - why would you walk here?"

If the player has previously "killed" Nightsong (she resurrects as she's immortal), she's bitter: "Was it everything you hoped for? Was it sweet, Sharran, to murder a paladin of Selune - her daughter - her sword?"

She threatens: "And I? I will come for you. When the time is right... That is when this immortal will visit you, Sharran. That is when I will show you what it is to be afraid."

If the player has the Spear of Night but isn't Shadowheart, Nightsong dismisses it: "The Spear of Night. You are not the Nightsinger's chosen champion - her weapon is useless in your hands."
