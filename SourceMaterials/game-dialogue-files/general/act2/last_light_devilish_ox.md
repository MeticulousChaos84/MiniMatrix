---

## Overview

The "ox" at Last Light Inn is actually a fiendish creature in an ox's body - a shapeshifter hiding among the refugees. It can show the player a horrific vision from its mind and may become aggressive if the player demands answers. Alternatively, if the player is evil-aligned, the ox may offer them a gift.

## Trigger

Speak to the ox in Last Light Inn's stable area. Requires Speak with Animals to understand it.

## The Creature's Nature

This is the same "Strange Ox" that appeared in the Emerald Grove in Act 1. It's:
- A shapeshifting fiend disguised as livestock
- Hiding among the refugees for unknown purposes
- Potentially dangerous if provoked
- Willing to reward those who share its dark nature

## Interaction Options

**Demanding answers:**
- The ox becomes hostile
- Transforms into its true form (a Shapeshifter/Phasm)
- Attacks the player and nearby NPCs

**Evil-aligned interaction:**
- The ox recognizes a kindred spirit
- Offers a mysterious gift
- Suggests meeting again later

**Leaving it alone:**
- The ox continues to hide among the refugees
- May appear again in Act 3

## The Horrific Vision

If the player probes the ox's mind, they receive a disturbing vision that hints at the creature's true nature and dark intentions.

## Combat

If the ox attacks:
- It transforms into a Shapeshifter
- Dammon and other nearby NPCs may be endangered
- The player receives thanks for dealing with it

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

*Note: The Strange Ox is a recurring mystery NPC that appears throughout all three acts. Its true identity and purpose are revealed in Act 3 if the player doesn't kill it earlier. Killing it at Last Light Inn removes this storyline but protects the refugees from potential danger. Dammon specifically thanks the player for dealing with "that hideous shapeshifted creature" if it's killed in his vicinity.*
