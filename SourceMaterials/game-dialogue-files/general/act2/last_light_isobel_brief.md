**Starting Node:** Various (state-dependent)

---

## Overview

This crucial scene occurs when the player meets Isobel in her room where she's re-casting the protective spell over the inn. She provides information about Ketheric Thorm and grants the player a spell to protect them from the Shadow Curse. However, the scene is interrupted by Marcus - an Absolute-tadpoled Flaming Fist - who attempts to kidnap Isobel on Ketheric's orders.

## Trigger

- Isobel has returned to her room after the lake scene
- Player doesn't yet know about Ketheric wanting Isobel at Moonrise

## Isobel's Brief

Before the attack, Isobel explains:
- The nature of the Shadow Curse
- Her relationship to Ketheric Thorm (revealed to be her father)
- The protective blessing she maintains
- Why Moonrise Towers holds the key to breaking the curse

She grants the player Isobel's Blessing - protection from the weaker Shadow Curse.

## Marcus's Attack

The scene is interrupted when Marcus, revealed as a True Soul infiltrator, crashes through the window/door and attempts to kidnap Isobel. He transforms into a monstrous winged form and the player must fight to protect her.

## Consequences

**If Marcus succeeds** (Isobel kidnapped or killed):
- The protective barrier falls
- Everyone at Last Light transforms into shadow undead
- This leads to HAV_Siege_Intro

**If player protects Isobel:**
- Last Light remains safe
- Marcus is defeated or flees
- Leads to HAV_TakingIsobel_FollowUpSaved

**If player helps Marcus:**
- Same consequences as kidnapping
- Jaheira becomes hostile
- Companions react with horror

*Note: This is one of the most consequential scenes in Act 2. The player's actions here determine whether Last Light Inn survives as a sanctuary or falls to the Shadow Curse, killing everyone inside. It's also the full reveal of Isobel as Ketheric's daughter - explaining why the cult leader wants her alive. Marcus's transformation into a winged monster is one of the more shocking visual reveals in the game.*
