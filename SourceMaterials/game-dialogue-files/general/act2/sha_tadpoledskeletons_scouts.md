The player encounters three skeletons controlled by Balthazar the Necromancer in the Shar Temple hallway. These skeletons share tadpoles and speak individually but in turns, all serving as mouthpieces for Balthazar himself.

The Narrator reveals: "Your mind upends. Somehow, in the decayed soup of this creature's brain, a tadpole lives. Another presence nurtures it, manipulates it like a puppet."

The skeletons immediately challenge the player: "You do not belong here" - speaking with "terse, rising anger." They detect the player's tadpole and recognize them as potentially useful: "Yet the Absolute has blessed you. Perhaps you will be useful. Present yourself at my camp and -"

If asked who they're speaking to, the skeletons explain:
- "I am their creator. I saved them from life. From death. From their skin and their flesh. Now they serve me."

If Shadowheart is present and knows she's a Shar worshipper:
- "No - *you* do not belong. This is the Dark Lady's house. She has no use for old, faithless bones."

The dialogue ends abruptly when the skeletons sense danger: "*- stupid, worm-infested cockhead!* You have awoken the shadows!" They then rally: "My forces are split. The defences are thin. Rally on me - a wall of bone and blade against the darkness. *Now!*" This triggers shadow attackers.

Players can:
- Mention Z'rell sent them to help Balthazar (the skeletons scoff: "Z'rell lacks imagination. Z'rell lacks faith.")
- Ask about the three corpses sharing one personality
- Tell them to leave (+1 Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin)
- Make Bard jokes about bone instruments
- Simply turn to leave
