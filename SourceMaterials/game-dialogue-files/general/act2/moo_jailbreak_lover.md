This conversation features: Danis.

Danis is a tiefling from the grove who is being held prisoner in Moonrise towers. In his initial dialogue he terrified and frantic and worried about his partner Bex (who the player may have met in last light inn). He is also a back up to get the escape quest if Lia and Lakrissa (two other tieflings) are dead.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Danis:** "Something's happening. Please, don't leave me in here. Please!"
- **Danis:** "I keep closing my eyes and praying I'll wake up somewhere else - anywhere else."
- **Danis:** "Something's happening. Please, don't leave me in here. Please!"
- **Danis:** "Hold on - this thing is in knots."
- **Danis:** "All I wanted was a little house in Baldur's Gate with Bex. Not this. Not any of this."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "I was."
- "Shouldn't you be worrying about yourself?"
- "Who?"
