This conversation features: Narrator, Questioner Sumera, Nightwarden Minthara, Questioner Jasin.

Minthara is being psychically tortured in the Moonrise Tower dungeon, having been sent there for failing in her mission to capture the weapon the Absolute was seeking (the Orpheus artefact).Two guards are torturing her, but they do not lay a finger on her. Instead, they have stripped away her psychic defenses and are using mind-melds to destroy her from the inside.The player can free her by killing the guards, or by mind-melding with Minthara and pulling her out of the despair. If she is freed from the mind-meld while the guards are alive, she kills them.The player can also destroy Minthara completely, by telepathically lobotomising her inside her own mind.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Questioner Sumera:** "You were adored, Minthara. Brought up from the darkness, and into the Absolute's light."
- **Questioner Jasin:** "She cherished you. But it wasn't enough - you were distracted by your own desires."
- **Questioner Sumera:** "Bloodlust. Murder. Chaos."
- **Questioner Jasin:** "And most damning of all, an unexpected weakness - a longing for acceptance, and affection. From a mortal."
- **Questioner Jasin:** "A mortal who disappointed you in ways the Absolute never would."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "What are you doing to her?"
- "Yes - I'm looking forward to watching her break."
- "I expected her to be dismembered. Disappointing."
