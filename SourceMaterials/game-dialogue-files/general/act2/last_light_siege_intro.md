# Last Light Inn - Shadow Siege Introduction

**Source:** `HAV_Siege_Intro.html`
**Starting Node:** 17 (standard) / 24 (Marcus alive) / 47 (player killed Isobel)

---

## Overview

This is one of the most devastating scenes in Act 2. When Isobel is kidnapped, killed, or otherwise removed from Last Light Inn, her protective barrier falls and the shadow curse floods in. The scene shows everyone at the inn being transformed into shadow-cursed undead while Jaheira confronts the player about what happened.

## Trigger Conditions

The siege triggers when:
- Isobel is kidnapped by Marcus
- Isobel is killed by the player
- Isobel is otherwise forcibly removed from the inn

## The Siege Begins

As the protective barrier falls, screams sound from inside the inn as darkness consumes the area. The player and Jaheira run out the front doors.

## Companion Reactions (If Player Caused This)

If companions can blame the player for Isobel's death/kidnapping:

**Karlach**: "What were you thinking?! What are we *doing* here?"

**Wyll**: "Shit. This was your doing. *All of it.*"

**Gale**: "Behold, the consequences of your actions."

## Jaheira's Confrontation

**Jaheira**: "Isobel. *No!* What in the Nine Hells happened?!"

### Player Response Options:

**If player was complicit with Marcus (he vouched for player at gate):**

1. **"He did, but I decided to handle him myself."**
   - Jaheira: "You don't get to decide. Not here. Not while I'm responsible for the lives of the people at this inn."

2. **"He didn't - I had no idea."** (Deception DC 14)
   - Success: Jaheira: "I suppose I have no choice but to believe you."
   - Failure: Jaheira: "Liar. Filthy liar."

3. **"There's no time for this. We have a shadow curse to deal with."** (Persuasion DC 18)
   - Success: Jaheira: "You're right. There's no stopping it now."
   - Failure: Jaheira: "In this moment, you are the greater threat."

4. **"He did. I thought it'd be fun to see what he had planned for you."**
   - Jaheira: "Blackguard! You're viler than the worm that's consuming you."

**If player directly killed/betrayed Isobel:**

1. **"I helped Marcus kidnap Isobel. And now I'm going to watch the shadows consume you."**
   - Jaheira: "You wretch! To think you had my trust. If this be my last act, let it be in service of strangling the life out of you."

2. **"I was curious to see what you would do without her."**
   - Same furious response

3. **Dark Urge**: "She was my sacrifice. It was a delight."
   - Jaheira: "You wretch! To think you had my trust..."

**If player killed Isobel directly:**

1. **"It looks like some kind of terrible accident."** (Deception DC 16)
   - Success: Jaheira: "I don't see how she... Unless some cultist sneaked in..."
   - Failure: Jaheira: "Liar! It was you who killed her."

2. **"Isobel and I got into a little spat."**
   - Jaheira: "*A little spat.*"
   - Jaheira: "I can't believe I didn't see you for what you are. A *murderer*. You killed her, and in doing so you've spelled our doom."

## Jaheira's Mission Brief (If Not Hostile)

If the player hasn't completely antagonized Jaheira:

**Jaheira**: "Isobel is gone. Soon the shadows will wash us all away."

"Listen closely, for there's very little time. Even if Last Light falls, you must destroy the cult of the Absolute."

"Their leader is a man called Ketheric Thorm. He resides in Moonrise Towers, and we've found him to be impervious to the blade, and to magic to boot."

"Even so, you *must* find him and you *must* kill him."

"As impossible as that task sounds, there must be a way to break the spell that makes him invincible. There are secrets in this ancient waste, hidden from..."

*She's interrupted*

"But hark! Something stirs..."

## The Transformation

The scene shifts outside where a generic Harper is the first to transform: He appears to suffocate, then falls, gasping and screaming; he contorts as the life is squeezed out of him, and rises again covered in Shadow Blight.

**Jaheira** (if Haven was hostile): "So it begins. So it will end."

**Jaheira** (if player has Isobel's protection): "It's happening. They'll all be taken by the shadows. Only by the grace of Isobel's spell will we be spared the same fate."

**Jaheira** (standard): "It's happening. They'll all be taken by the shadows."

## Battle Lines

**If Jaheira is hostile to player:**
"For a little while longer, you and I are destined to fight side by side, but if the shades don't take you, I have the next claim on your head."

**If Jaheira is not hostile:**
"We cannot hesitate. Not even for those we knew - those we cared for. They're no longer who they were."

"Steel your hearts and steady your hands. To battle!"

## Haven Already Hostile Path

If the player already made Haven hostile before this scene:

**Jaheira**: "Do you understand what you've done? Without Isobel, everyone in this inn is as good as dead!"

"I trusted you. Silvanus forgive me, I let you in."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Behold, the consequences of your actions." (if player caused Isobel's death/kidnapping)

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Karlach:** "What were you thinking?! What are we *doing* here?" (if player caused Isobel's death/kidnapping)

**Wyll:** "Shit. This was your doing. *All of it.*" (if player caused Isobel's death/kidnapping)

*Note: This is one of the most punishing consequences in the game for player choices. Letting Isobel be taken or killing her results in the deaths of everyone at Last Light Inn - tieflings, Harpers, Flaming Fist, and potentially important NPCs like Dammon and Art the Ancient Fist. Gale's line is particularly cutting as he directly holds the player accountable.*
