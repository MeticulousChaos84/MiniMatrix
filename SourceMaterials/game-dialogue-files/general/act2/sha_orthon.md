# Yurgir the Orthon - Post-Truce Dialogue

**Source:** `SHA_Orthon.html`
**Starting Node:** 7

---

This dialogue triggers after the player has successfully convinced Yurgir the Orthon to let them stay in his lair. The player agreed to search the temple for a way to free him from his contract with Raphael.

If the player returns after resolving the Last Justiciar contract:

**If the player killed the Justiciar:** Yurgir realizes the song has stopped - "Wait... *quiet*... It's gone. The song is gone! *The contract is completed!*" Raphael appears and points out Yurgir is in breach of contract for "subcontracting" the kill. Raphael offers a new contract, and Yurgir reluctantly accepts ("Bastard. Fine. On one condition - no more songs.").

**If the player spared the Justiciar:** They can inform Yurgir of the location and then confront him about denying his prey, leading to combat.

Karlach has significant dialogue with Yurgir. He smells Zariel's "infernal machinery" on her and reveals: "Whatever engine burns within you is grinding to an inevitable explosion. Burning and fear - you *reek* with it."

Players can:
- Tell Yurgir who they are ("An orthon. Fancy seeing one of you so far from the Hells.")
- Claim they are a Dark Justiciar (triggers combat)
- Report finding the last Justiciar
- Ask about the charmed displacer beast
- Ask about the strange rats
- Request hunting advice (he mocks: "*Suggestions?* So much for your superior hunting skills.")

Yurgir explains his contract: "I was bid by Raphael to slay every Justiciar I found in this place. The contract was a song, one stuck in my head until I finished the deed. I had to hum that blasted tune for *years*."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Can we please kill it this time?" (if Raphael asked him to kill the Orthon and he's met it before - stress on "please")

**Astarion:** "This is what Raphael wants us to kill? Well, if that's what it takes to figure out what these damn scars mean..." (first time meeting Orthon after Raphael's quest - not looking forward to the fight)
