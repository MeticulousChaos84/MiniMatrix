After the player enters Nightsong's prison in the Shadowfell, Balthazar appears behind them, having followed them through Shar's defenses. This dialogue sets up the final confrontation over the Nightsong's fate.

For Shadowheart as origin, special narration plays: "The Shadowfell. Never before have you found yourself so close to Lady Shar's embrace. The fulfilment of her command is so close now. You must allow nothing to stop you."

If Shadowheart is a companion, she comments: "Lady Shar... I can feel her all around. This is her domain. This is the Shadowfell."

Balthazar arrives levitating, and his greeting varies:
- **If the player agreed to help him:** "You did well - better than I would have credited you with. Now hurry along and bear witness to my masterpiece."
- **If the player refused to help:** "I knew you would do my bidding - even though you pretended otherwise."
- **Fallback:** "You cleared the way for me, True Soul. What promising flesh you are. As a reward, I shall let you bear witness to my masterpiece."

Balthazar explains he used the player to bypass Shar's defenses: "I had been trying to reach this place, to retrieve something of great value. And thanks to you, the path is unblocked. *Bravo.*"

If asked how he got there: "Simple - I followed you. It seems Shar bears a grudge against my master, General Thorm, and so sought to prevent me from entering in his name."

If challenged to a fight, Balthazar threatens: "Your lack of ability, perhaps? You made for an adequate errand-boy thus far, but let's not overstate your virtues. Raise one finger to me and I'd sunder you like lightning would a rotten oak."

Shadowheart (companion) disdainfully notes: "This is the Dark Lady's domain - *he* does not belong here."
