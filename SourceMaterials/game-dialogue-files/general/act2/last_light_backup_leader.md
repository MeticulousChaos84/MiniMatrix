**Source:** `HAV_BackupLeader.html`
**Starting Node:** 34 (Zevlor was leader) / 15 (others) / 11 (already met)

---

## Overview

Cerys is a tiefling scout who has reluctantly assumed leadership of the refugees after Zevlor was taken during the cultist ambush. Exhausted by the responsibility but capable of gallows humor, she provides a pragmatic counterpoint to Alfira's emotional perspective on their situation.

## First Encounter

**Cerys**: "Thought you'd be ten yards tall, the way Zevlor spoke of you." (if Zevlor was leader)

or

**Cerys**: "Thought you'd be ten yards tall, the way my people speak of you." (if another led)

She introduces herself: "Cerys. Scout. Seems we missed one another at the grove, but the others told me how you helped us."

**If player already knows Cerys** (she was leader before): "I owe you an apology. You pulled my people from one death-trap, only for me to land them in another."

## The Ambush

**Cerys**: "We were ambushed out in the cursed lands - cultists of this Absolute. Zevlor froze, begged us to surrender, but..."

"They were toying with us. *Making examples*. And we'd had enough of taking it."

"Those of us who cut free just kept running 'til we found this place. The others... maybe the cult got them. Maybe the curse."

## Player Responses to the Ambush

**Encouraging**: "Don't lose hope. The others might still be alive."
- Approval: All companions +1
- Cerys: "Zevlor had hope. It didn't save him. A little sense will serve us better, I think."
- Cerys: "But... thanks. It was sweet of you to try."

**Critical**: "Sounds like you made a right mess of things."
- Approval: Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Cerys: "Aye, I did. Maybe you'd have been the one to save us all, if you'd been there."
- Cerys: "Or maybe you'd be missing along with the rest."

**Harsh**: "So you abandoned them."
- Same approval split as above
- Cerys accepts the criticism without pretense

## Class-Specific Responses

**Barbarian**: "*Coward.*"
- Cerys: "Heroism is no comfort to the dead."

**Fighter**: "You didn't stand your ground? You deserted your allies? Disgraceful."

**Paladin** (not Oathbreaker): "Have you no shame? You were tasked with protecting these people, yet you *ran.*"

**Oathbreaker**: "Your life is your own - you owe these people nothing. You were right to run."
- Different approval split: Gale +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Karlach +1, Halsin +1 / Lae'zel -1, Astarion -1, Minthara -1

**Cleric** (Good): "To despair is fruitless. To hope is divine - do *not* give up."
- Cerys: "Hope? You would bid me *hope?*"
- Cerys: "We've no brighter horizon ahead of us. There's just the city - *if* I can get us there alive."

**Cleric** (Neutral): "Cultists, curse - it matters not. The past is done. Focus on moving forward."
- Cerys: "Move forward to *what* exactly?"

**Ranger**: "Do you think the cult planned this? Or was it a surprise attack?"
- Cerys: "It's hard to tell. We were alone in the darkness one moment, surrounded the next."

**Monk**: "You let your fear conquer you. Be careful not to let your life be ruled by it."
- Cerys: "We're in a dilapidated inn, surrounded by cursed darkness - only a fool wouldn't be afraid."

## The Route to Baldur's Gate

If the player asks why they're in the Shadow-Cursed Lands:

**Cerys**: "This army of the Absolute is growing, and flowing towards Moonrise. There's worse than goblins on the roads now."

"I thought we might pass unnoticed along the fringes of this place. Escape the owlbear by hiding in its shadow, so to speak."

"You can see exactly how well that went."

## After the Rescue

**All prisoners saved**: "We're bruised, battered... but we're together again. You damn well brought them *back.*"

**Some prisoners saved**: "Seems not everyone made it out of that tower. But it'd be none at all without you - thank you. Truly."

If Zevlor was leader: "I looked for Zevlor among those who came back. No matter his fate... I know he'd be grateful to you. I am too."

**If player reports all prisoners died**:

**Cerys**: "...That's that, then."

"I'll make sure the others know you tried, but nothing's changed."

"We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and what's left of us is damn well getting there."

## After Nightsong is Freed

**Cerys**: "Glad to see you again. I was afraid you'd get swallowed up by the shadows. Instead, you've found us some cavalry. Very well done."

or

**Cerys**: "This place has been buzzing with talk of an adventurer who found us an angel. Sounds like salvation to me, don't you think?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Disapproves (-1) of abandonment accusations but approves (+1) of encouraging/pragmatic responses.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of critical and harsh responses but disapproves (-1) of Oathbreaker-style pragmatism interestingly.*

*Note: Cerys represents a more realistic perspective on the refugees' situation - pragmatic, tired, and focused on survival rather than heroism. Her character provides good contrast to both Zevlor's guilt and Alfira's emotional approach.*
