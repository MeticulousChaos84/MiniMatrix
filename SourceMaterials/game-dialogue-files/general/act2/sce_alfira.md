This conversation features: Alfira.

Alfira is leading the kids in a bit of fun moment of constructing their story into a ballad of sorts. When the player arrives they will have just finished up the lyrics and if the player is a bard, Alfira will invite them to play along with. At the end of the duet (gameplay playing animation with music, not a full cinematic) the Bard is given the Shining Dawn ability.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Alfira:** "Sorry, now is not a good time - the kids need me."
- **Alfira:** "Ah! A fellow bard. Sorry to ask out of the blue, but would you like to play together?"
- **Alfira:** "The kids have been really down - I figured a concert would cheer them up. Or distract them, at least. What do you say?"
- **Alfira:** "I hope I'll find a bard in the city. The kids would love a little show, I'm sure of it!"
- **Alfira:** "You're lucky to be travelling with such a talented musician - I hope I run into you both in the city."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "Are you all right?"
- "I was expecting a little more enthusiasm."
- "I'm sure they appreciate it."
