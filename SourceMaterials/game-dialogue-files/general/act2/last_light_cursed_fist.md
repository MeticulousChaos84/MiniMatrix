# Last Light Inn - The Cursed Flaming Fist (Art Cullagh)

**Source:** `HAV_CursedFist.html`
**Starting Node:** Various (state-dependent)

---

## Overview

The player encounters Cullagh, a cursed Flaming Fist soldier who was trapped at the inn when the Shadow Curse fell - meaning he's been there for a century. He's currently unresponsive, barely conscious, and Fist J'ehlar is trying to communicate with him. Cullagh hums an old tune repeatedly, unable to speak or engage meaningfully. If the player retrieves his dulcimer (Art's dulcimer) and plays it, Cullagh can begin to come around and wake up.

## Trigger

Walk up to Cullagh (S_SCL_AncientFist_MartCullagh) in Last Light Inn and interact with him.

## The Scene

J'ehlar is attempting to communicate with Cullagh when the player approaches. She doesn't want to talk over his head and tries to include him in any conversation, even though he can barely respond.

## Gale's Insight

During this scene, Gale recognizes the potential solution:

**Gale**: "Music's a powerful source of memories. We might be able to bring him around if we find what he used to play."

*This is a crucial hint pointing players toward finding the dulcimer in the Shadow-Cursed Lands.*

## Resolution

When the player finds and plays Art's dulcimer for Cullagh, he begins to wake from his century-long fugue state. He can then provide information about what happened when the curse fell and potentially about Thaniel - the cursed boy who is key to breaking the Shadow Curse.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Music's a powerful source of memories. We might be able to bring him around if we find what he used to play."

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

*Note: Art Cullagh is one of the oldest surviving witnesses to the fall of Reithwin and the original Shadow Curse. His connection to Thaniel through the dulcimer is essential for the player's quest to break the curse and reach Moonrise Towers through the Shadowfell.*
