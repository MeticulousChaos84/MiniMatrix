# Thisobald Thorm - The Brewer

**Source:** `TWN_Distillery_Brewer.html`
**Starting Node:** 179

---

In the Waning Moon distillery, the player encounters Thisobald Thorm - a bloated, monstrous creature who was once Ketheric's son. The curse has twisted him beyond measure, turning him into a grotesque drunk who demands company for his drinking sessions.

Thisobald greets the player: "Drink, gulp it down, wet your whistle. Tell your *story*."

The player can enter a drinking contest with Thisobald, telling stories to entertain him while he drinks. Successful Performance checks convince him to drink more, and the player can keep him drinking until he literally explodes from overconsumption.

As the player observes his bloated form, the Narrator notes: "*Leaning in, you can see how the creature's skin barely holds it together. The bulge of its belly is on the cusp of bursting wide open.*"

Players must pass Constitution saves to avoid being poisoned by his incredibly potent alcohol. Various storytelling options include:
- Tales of witnessing the Hells from a mind flayer vessel
- Describing the beauty of a druid's grove
- Dark Urge players can recount massacring innocents

Thisobald reacts to good stories: "I am transported. I see the grove, the green, the grace before me!" and bad ones with disdain: "Beauty is boring, nature a nuisance. I am dulled, you are dullard."

If the player refuses to drink or fails to entertain him, combat ensues.

Note: These are origin character lines (spoken when playing as that character).

**Astarion** (origin, observing Thisobald's bloated form): "Keep your distance. He looks like he could burst any second."

**Gale** (origin, observing Thisobald's bloated form): "Look at the thing... A few more tastes of its own medicine and it'll burst."
