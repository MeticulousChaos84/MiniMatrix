This is the player's first encounter with Yurgir the Orthon in his lair. The orthon is a terrifying devil who was sent by Raphael to kill Ketheric's Dark Justiciars and has been trapped in the temple for years.

The player enters a gore-soaked alcove with severed heads on display and a throne made of eviscerated corpses. Yurgir ambushes them from above, aiming a crossbow at the player while flanked by merregons.

Yurgir greets the player: "What's this? *Fresh entertainment.*"

He can smell infernal scents on the player and specifically recognizes the smell of Raphael: "There's something else, almost hidden by your fear-stink... cherries, musk... and *sulphur*."

When Yurgir realizes the player has been near Raphael, he becomes furious: "*Raphael!* I can smell him all over you. Where is he?!"

The player can ask about Raphael, and Yurgir explains: "That perfumed trickster swindled me - *trapped* me."

If Karlach is present (as companion), she warns: "Holy shit. An orthon. Powerful devils - I wouldn't get on their bad side without a good reason."

Yurgir recognizes Karlach's infernal engine and reveals its grim fate: "Only what I can smell. And whatever engine burns within you is grinding to an inevitable explosion. Burning and fear - you *reek* with it."

Players can try to negotiate with Yurgir about their mutual enemy in Raphael, though the dialogue typically ends in combat unless players succeed at very hard persuasions.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion** (if Raphael asked him to kill the Orthon): "So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?"

**Astarion** (follow-up): "Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars."
