This conversation features: Nightsong, Ketheric Thorm.

When you arrive on the rooftop after making Ketheric vulnerable, he will be shivering and furious at the fact that his invulnerability has been taken from him. The Tower is under attack and he's in a desperate state. He will fight the player, unless by a huge stroke of luck the player convinces him to surrender. Edge-case path: Audience with the Absolute (captured Nightsong then messed up Z'rell)

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Ketheric Thorm:** "YOU! What have you done?! What have you done to me?!"
- **Ketheric Thorm:** "YOU! What have you done?! What have you done to me?!"

- **Ketheric Thorm:** "Impossible. You are a thrall - a slave!"

**Sample Player Choices:**
