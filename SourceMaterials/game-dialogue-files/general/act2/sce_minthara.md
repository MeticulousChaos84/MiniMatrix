**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:**
- "I'll get little rest given the stack of unread books waiting for me - but I'll try."
- "The mind is strong, but the knees... well, they are a little sore. I'll gladly put my feet up."
- "Keeping your greatest weapon in reserve, eh? An excellent strategy."

**Astarion:**
- "If I must. Do try to keep them safe - they're a little useless without me."
- "Oh, gladly. This circus is all yours, my friend."
- "This is my replacement? Good luck to you both."
