# Last Light Inn - Dammon the Infernal Weaponsmith

**Source:** `HAV_TieflingSurvivors_Weaponsmith.html`
**Starting Node:** 65 (first meeting) / 50 (return visit)

## Overview

Dammon is the tiefling weaponsmith who survived the fall of Elturel into Avernus. His experience forging in a devil's smithy gave him unique skills working with infernal metals. At Last Light Inn, he can craft powerful weapons from hellish materials the player brings him. He's also crucial to Karlach's story, as he's the only one who can repair her infernal engine.

## First Meeting

**Dammon**: "It's - you! What are the odds? So glad you're all right. Well - as all right as any of us."

**If Karlach has already visited**: "Glad you and Karlach are all right. Well - as all right as any of us."

**Dammon**: "A makeshift Harper's fire might not be where I *hoped* to set up shop, but maybe I've got something you can use anyway."

**Dammon**: "And if you find any interesting materials in need of working, I'm happy to help."

## If Player Killed the Shapeshifter Ox

**Dammon**: "I *thought* it was you - saving my skin again, I see. Never seen a shapeshifted ox before, but I'm glad you dealt with it before *it* dealt with *us*."

**On return**: "Gods above and devils below! That ox was a bloody shapeshifter! Thanks for handling it."

## The Infernal Metal Quest

**"'Interesting' materials? What do you mean?"**

**Dammon**: "I... hesitated to mention this back in the druids' grove - for obvious reasons - but no one has earned my trust if not you."

**Dammon**: "When Elturel was dragged into Avernus, I was drafted into a devil's smithy. It *should* have been awful, but infernal metal is like a wild horse. Powerful, exuberant - it'll kill you if you lack technique."

**Dammon**: "I can sense some, smell it almost, somewhere in the area. Underground, maybe - out there, in the shadows."

**Dammon**: "If you find it, bring it to me. I'll make something *incredible.*"

## Discussing His Time in Avernus

**"Sounds like you had an interesting time in the Hells."**

**Dammon**: "Some of us had it easier than others. The baker, the schoolmaster - when Elturel was swallowed up, they could do little but survive."

**Dammon**: "As for me, I won't say I *enjoyed* my time there, but it was certainly... instructional."

*Note: He secretly did enjoy it but considers it gauche to say so.*

## Bringing Infernal Materials

**"I've got this metal I found in Avernus itself - will that do?"**
- Requires: Metal from Tutorial/Nautiloid
- Dammon takes it and forges

**"I found this metal in a place called Grymforge - what do you make of it?"**
- Requires: Infernal Plate from Underdark
- Dammon takes it and forges

**"I think I found a material you could work with. What can you make of it?"**
- General option for any infernal metal

### Forging Results

**First piece**: "Absolutely. Rare to get your hands on this stuff - well done keeping it to hand."

**Second piece**: "It's perfect, really. Just a moment - I'll be able to work this one quickly."

**Third piece**: "Well, well, well... I *knew* I smelled something. And I know just what to do with it. One moment."

**After forging**: "There you are. And be careful who you show that to. It might draw the wrong kind of attention."

**If player doesn't have the metal**: "Perhaps you've misplaced it? I'll be here should you find it again."

## Merregon Masks

**"I found some hellish masks, can you make anything of these?"**

**Dammon**: "Using something that's already fabricated is tough, but I can try. How many do you have?"

**One mask**:
- Dammon: "Hm. I thought I sniffed a Merregon's scent somewhere. These must've been a pain to get a hold of."
- Dammon: "Merregon masks are brittle, so what I make won't last as long as my usual pieces."
- Dammon: "There. Be careful who sees you using that, might draw the wrong sort of eyes."

**Two/Three/Four masks**: Same introduction, scales reward

**"Actually, I'll hang on to them."**
- Dammon: "Fair enough, they might have use as they are."
- Dammon: "If you want me to have another look, you know where to find me."

## Alert State (After Spy Discovery)

**Dammon**: "Nowhere's safe from this damned Absolute."

**If ox killed**: "Nor from shapeshifting cow-blob-things, though you made short enough work of that one."

**Dammon**: "If you need something sharp, I have a few things left."

**Return visit**: "Can't sleep, so I might as well hammer. Need anything?"

## After Nightsong Freed

**First meeting**: "There you are! I'd hoped you'd made it through, but when we didn't hear from you... well. I'm glad you're here now."

**Subsequent**: "Did you see it? The path of light? That's good, right? Means we might make it out of here alive."

**Later**: "Isobel said we ought to sit tight for the time being - wait until we hear back from Jaheira. I know she's right, but I can't wait to get moving."

## General Return Visit

**Dammon**: "Need anything?"

**"Let's see what you have."**
- Opens trade

**After trade**: "I'll be here if you need anything else."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

*Note: Dammon is one of the most important NPCs for Karlach's storyline - he's the only person who can repair her infernal engine. His unique expertise in infernal metallurgy, gained during Elturel's time in Avernus, makes him invaluable. The weapons he crafts from infernal materials are among the strongest in Act 2. His admission that he "won't say he enjoyed" his time in Avernus while clearly having found it fascinating adds depth to his character.*
