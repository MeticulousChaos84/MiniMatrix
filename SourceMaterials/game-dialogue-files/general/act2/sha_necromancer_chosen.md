# Balthazar - The Necromancer's Introduction

This large dialogue file covers Balthazar's interactions at the Shar Temple. Balthazar is Ketheric Thorm's trusted advisor and necromancer, seeking the Nightsong relic.

The dialogue branches based on whether the player has previously met Balthazar, agreed to help him, or is an outcast from Moonrise. Balthazar arrives through levitation, typically condescending and self-important.

Key narrative points:
- Balthazar introduces himself as General Thorm's trusted advisor
- He's been trying to reach the Nightsong and used the player to bypass Shar's defenses
- He threatens players who defy him, warning he could "sunder you like lightning would a rotten oak"
- If the player is an outcast from Moonrise, he immediately turns hostile

Players can:
- Demand better payment than mere thanks
- Claim they have their own reasons for being there
- Ask how he arrived (he followed the player past Shar's defenses)
- Challenge him to a fight
- Simply follow along

Shadowheart, if present, notes that Balthazar doesn't belong in Lady Shar's sacred realm.
