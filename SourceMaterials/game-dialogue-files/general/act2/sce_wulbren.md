This conversation features: Narrator, Wulbren Bongle.

This dialogue is peak Wulbren. If he's met you in haven (after you saved him), he rolls back on how rude he was as he realises the player would be an amazing asset in the city. If this is your first time meeting him since the escape (if haven is destroyed he waits out on the river until this scene in the epilogue), he realises how good the player would be to have on his side in the city and tells him all about how wronged the ironhand gnomes were.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Wulbren Bongle:** "We'll be heading for Baldur's Gate soon. If fate wills it, I'll see you there."
- **Wulbren Bongle:** "Bring every scrap of courage you have to Baldur's Gate - you'll need it for what's to come."
- **Wulbren Bongle:** "I owe you an apology."
- **Wulbren Bongle:** "Barcus and I are another matter - I'm dealing with you right now."
- **Wulbren Bongle:** "In a sense - yes. But that's because I didn't know what you were capable of."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "It's Barcus you should apologise to. Your reunion in Last Light was... strained."
- "For what?"
- "I'm listening."
