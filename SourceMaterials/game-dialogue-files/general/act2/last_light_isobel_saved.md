*Note: This scene represents the "good" outcome of the Marcus attack - Last Light survives, but the sanctuary is now known to be compromised. The shift to Alert state changes many NPC dialogues throughout the inn and increases the sense of urgency for the player to complete their mission before another attack can be launched.*
