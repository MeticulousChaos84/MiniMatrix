This conversation features: Lia, Cal.

This is lia's main dialogue in moonrise towers. She's been taken captive (along with her brother cal) - she doesn't know if her other brother rolan is alive or dead. Lia is brave and used to being in tough situations, but she's terrified for herself anf her brother (and trying to mask it with anger). Her main dialogue occurs with her in a cell and speaking to the player on the other side of the bars. There are additional branches for when she's in one cell and the player was arrested an in the cell next to her.

- **Lia:** "I swear, the moment these ropes are off they're going around your neck."

- **Lia:** "You! You're from the grove. Are you all right?"
- **Lia:** "No kidding. What are you even doing here?"
- **Lia:** "I take it getting locked up wasn't part of it?"
