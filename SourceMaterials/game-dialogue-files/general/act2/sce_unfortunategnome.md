This conversation features: Barcus Wroot.

He's a bit mopey but is very much wanting to stick by Wulbren's side despite being mistreated by him. He doesn't know what's happening next but he knows Wulbren has a plan. So that's something.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Barcus Wroot:** "There you are. I was wondering where the devil you'd been."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "Who? Oh - right. Well, forget about that magungus. We have more important things to worry about. Like Wulbren."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "Oh, forget about that. Wulbren and the Ironhand Gnomes are planning something dreadful in the city."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "You'll what? Tie me to a windmill? Enslave me in the Underdark? Smack me upside the head? I assure you, circumstance has beaten you to it."
- **Barcus Wroot:** "But it doesn't do to remain smackèd. We fall, we moan, then we rise to annoy our enemies once more."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "I was preoccupied defeating Ketheric Thorm."
- "Barcus, Wulbren wants nothing to do with you. He made that clear."
- "If I have to hear the name 'Wulbren' one more time..."
