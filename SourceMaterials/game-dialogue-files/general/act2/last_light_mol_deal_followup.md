## Overview

After the lanceboard game with Raphael (HAV_MolsDeal_Lanceboard_ThreeWay), Mol retreats to a corner by the bar where she's shoved the lanceboard. She's clearly stolen a piece from the set, fiddling with it as the player approaches. This dialogue allows the player to confront her about Raphael's deal and try to warn her away from making a devil's bargain.

## Opening

**If player lost the lanceboard game:**
**Mol**: "Should've trusted my gut instead of asking for help."
**Mol**: "Nothin' personal."

**If player won the lanceboard game:**
**Mol**: "Nice strategy back there."
**Mol**: "If we put our heads together, I bet you and me could make a tidy stack of coin in Baldur's Gate."
**Mol**: "But Raphael's offered me a partnership already, and it seems like a sweeter deal than throwing my lot in with you."

## Karlach's Interjection

When Mol mentions Raphael's partnership:

**Karlach**: "No, kid. No."

*Note: This is Karlach's protective instinct kicking in - she knows firsthand what devil deals cost.*

## Warning Mol About Raphael

**Tiefling Option**: "Our kind have enough trouble with devils. You should stay away from this one."
- Mol: "If our kind looked out for one another, we wouldn't need to deal with devils."

**Dark Urge Option**: "Make a deal with a devil, little one. Once you fall, you'll never look back."
- Sets flag: Player encouraged deal
- Mol: "Hey! I'm not so little! Grown-up enough to have grown up ages ago."

**Dark Urge (Resist)**: "Though it can be near-impossible to stay on the good path, you have to try. We all have to try."
- Sets flag: Warned about Raphael

**Standard Warning**: "You need to stay away from Raphael. His deals are poison."
- Mol: "Poison. Sure."
- Mol: "You must love the taste of it. He seems to know you pretty well."

**Monk Option**: "Like a prick from a scorpion, Raphael's deals seem innocuous, but they are poison."
- Same response about player knowing Raphael

## Class-Specific Warnings

**Cleric**: "This isn't about me, it's about your *soul*. What did he really offer?"
- Persuasion DC 16 to get truth

**Bard**: "Devils of lore don't deal in such low stakes, Mol. What'd he *really* offer?"
- Persuasion DC 16 to get truth

**Ranger**: "I can read you like a book, Mol - call it hunter's instincts. Now tell me, what did he really offer?"
- Persuasion DC 16 to get truth

**Paladin**: "You need to believe in *yourself*, Mol. Not the empty promises of a fork-tongued monster."
- Mol: "Zevlor had *belief* - didn't get him anywhere good."

**Fighter**: "One should consider all options before forming a battle strategy - not just the easiest deal."
- Mol: "There aren't any other options, *soldier*. Raphael said he could keep me and my kids safe, and that's that."

## Warlock Warnings

Different warnings based on patron type:

**Great Old One**: "He's a devil, Mol. They are fickle patrons - ambition and treason lie before you."

**Archfey**: "Be careful, little one. Raphael's a devil - they're lying bastards. Hardly *fun* patrons."

**Fiend**: "I swore a pact with a creature like Raphael once. He's a devil, Mol. Be cautious."

**Default**: "Careful, Mol. Deals with a devil always cut both ways."
- Mol: "So what if Raphael's a devil? Means he's got the power to keep his promise."
- Mol: "Also - bit rich for *you* to tell me who I can or can't make deals with. All things considered."

## The Truth About Raphael's Offer

If player succeeds at Persuasion checks (DC 14-20):

**Mol**: "What I said! That he'd get me and my gang safely to Baldur's Gate."
**Mol**: "And also... when we get there, I'd be head of the Thieves' Guild."

**If player asks about current Guild head:**
**Mol**: "I dunno, devil stuff? What matters is I can keep my kids safe. Everyone else's let them down, but I won't."

## Encouraging the Deal (Evil Path)

**"If Raphael offered you a good trade, you should take it."**
- Sets flag: Encouraged deal
- If Paladin: Breaks oath
- Mol: "No idea if it's good or not. A lot of people like to promise pretty things, but it's empty air."

**Rogue Option**: "Take the deal if you want, kid. But a word of advice - let him get a little desperate first."
- Sets flag: Encouraged deal
- Mol: "Yeah, that's the way to go. His lanceboard trick was meant to soften me up, but I know better."

## Mol's Justification

**If Zevlor is dead**: "Not like we have anyone in charge now. Zev's dead."

**If tieflings won at grove**: "Look, you saved us. Not knockin' that. But after you left, Zevlor lost his nerve - gave up the fight. I won't."

**If player didn't help at grove**: "You could have helped us. With the goblins, with the druids. But you saved your own skin."
- Mol: "I get looking out for number one - respect it, even. So if I make a deal, you can be damn sure it's what's best for me and my crew."

## Ending Lines

**Standard ending**: "Maybe I'll make a deal, maybe I won't. But it'll be *my* choice - not the devil's and not yours."

**If wondering about cleric's promised milk**: "Wonder if I could con some gold off that cleric."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Karlach:** "No, kid. No." (when Mol mentions Raphael's partnership offer)

*Note: This dialogue reveals Mol's ambition - she's not just seeking safety for the tiefling children, she wants to become head of the Thieves' Guild in Baldur's Gate. Her deal with Raphael has far greater stakes than simple protection. Players can either warn her away or encourage her ambition, with class-specific dialogue for those who have their own experience with patrons and pacts.*
