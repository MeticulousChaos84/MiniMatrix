# Arabella - Reunion in the Shadow-Cursed Lands

**Source:** `TWN_ArabellasPowers_TownIntroduction.html`
**Starting Node:** 75

---

The player encounters Arabella again in the shadow-cursed lands - the tiefling girl they rescued from Kagha's snake in Act 1. She has developed mysterious powers and is fighting shadow creatures.

She recognizes the player: "Hey - I know you! You're -" but is interrupted by shadow creatures emerging from the ground.

Arabella uses her new power to entangle them with magical vines: "*Twist'em up!*"

She explains her situation: "Sorry. Knocks the wind right out of me."

Arabella reveals she came to the Shadow-Cursed Lands with her parents following Zevlor: "We followed Zevlor out here. Then he - he -" She struggles to continue, then: "Well. There was an ambush. Mum yelled 'run!' So we ran."

"I could hear 'em running behind me. 'Til I couldn't."

She asks the player for help: "Still can't find 'em - but I bet you can. You'll help me, I just know it!"

If the player has already found her parents' corpses, a Passive Insight check reveals: "*You notice the girl shivering in fear and anger. She is not yet ready to hear the truth of her parents' fate.*"

Players can:
- Promise to find her parents (+1 Gale, Shadowheart, Karlach, Halsin; +3 Wyll; -1 Minthara)
- Say they'll think about it
- Eventually be guilt-tripped into helping after her outburst: "Fine. Whatever. I don't need you - I'll find them myself!"

Arabella asks to stay with the party until they find her parents: "The vines won't last forever. I don't - I don't s'pose I can stay with you? Just 'til you find mum and pops. I won't be any trouble, I swear it!"
