# Object of Darkness Trial - Stealth and Infiltration

This dialogue triggers when a player interacts with the statue to begin the stealth trial in the Shar Temple. This trial tests initiates' skills of stealth and infiltration.

The Narrator describes: "The bowl contains an ancient, rust-coloured bloodstain. It forms a neat disc, as if spilled calmly and willingly."

If Shadowheart recognizes the trial (as origin or companion), she provides context: "You recognise this as a trial, where initiates would prove themselves to Lady Shar. This one would put their skills of stealth and infiltration to the test."

When Shadowheart is in the party, she requests to perform the trial:
- First time: "This is one of Lady Shar's trials. Allow me - it's important."
- If already done another trial: "Another trial. I should do this one as well."
- If previously refused at this statue: "If you're going to hesitate, just stand aside and let me do the trial myself."

Players can:
- Allow Shadowheart to proceed (+5 approval) - she cuts her hand with a dagger
- Refuse her request (-1 approval)

If refused with high approval, Shadowheart responds: "These trials mean something to me, don't you understand? I thought I could rely on you."

If refused with low approval: "This is no time to indulge your pettiness. These trials are important to me."

If the player does the trial themselves after refusing Shadowheart, she comments acidly: "Try not to hit an artery."

Players can also:
- Gaze at the statue to hear Shar's voice: "Reach the other side to receive my gift."
- Offer their own blood (Shar worshippers get special text)
- Leave without doing the trial
