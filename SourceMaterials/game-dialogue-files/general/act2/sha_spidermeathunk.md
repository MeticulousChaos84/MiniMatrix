# The Spider Meat Hunk - Charmed Carrion

The player finds a well-chewed spider carcass in the Orthon's lair - the same meat the Displacer Beast has been eating. This seemingly disgusting corpse holds a dark secret: it's been charmed with succubus spittle.

The Narrator describes: "A well-chewed spider carcass oozes on the ground." Wizards automatically detect "the prickling, metallic whiff of magic."

Players can investigate several ways:
- Study it (DC 14 Investigation) - reveals "fresh bite marks, an old puncture wound, and a faint pulse of something not entirely natural"
- Scan for magical interference (DC 16 Arcana, with bonuses for Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard) - reveals "the meat is oozing, but not with blood - it's been dosed with a *potion*"
- Inspect bite marks as Druid/Ranger - reveals "the teeth of the predator are curved, pointed, and have sunk in deep - some sort of feline"

The most entertaining options involve licking the meat:

First lick (DC 6 Constitution):
- **Success:** "The meat tastes of rot and sour milk. Your stomach lurches, but your loins *tingle*. Was that *arousal*...?" The player discovers the meat contains "succubus spittle" and is charmed.
- **Failure:** "You feel hot bile rising in your throat as your body breaks into a sweat. Your vision blurs and your legs threaten to give in." Player gets poisoned.

Dark Urge gets special text: "Indulge in a lick of the raw carrion."

Second lick (always poisons): "Your guts cramp, your stomach churns, and your nerves burn with a pain that would almost be pleasurable were it not so savage."

**Approval:** Licking the meat: Karlach +1, Gale -1, Shadowheart -1, Lae'zel -1, Wyll -1, Minthara -1, Halsin -1

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale** (if player passes Constitution and becomes aroused): "If what is happening is what I think is happening, and it's because you licked a dead spider - the time might just have come when you and I should split ways."

**Gale** (if player fails Constitution and gets poisoned): "You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened."

**Gale** (follow-up to above): "I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues."

**Gale** (if player licks it again): "Stop licking the damn thing!"

**Astarion** (if player passes Constitution and becomes aroused): "Rotten meat? That's what gets you going? Well, to each their own."

**Astarion** (if player fails Constitution and gets poisoned): "You are absolutely vile. Gods above."

**Astarion** (if player licks it again): "Well, that's what you get for being greedy."
