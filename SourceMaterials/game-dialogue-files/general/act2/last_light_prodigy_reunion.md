## Overview

This is an intensely emotional scene where Cal and/or Lia have been rescued from Moonrise Towers and reunited with Rolan at Last Light Inn. Rolan's worry manifests as anger - he lashes out at his surviving siblings, blaming them for not protecting each other. The player must intervene to calm the situation and remind them what truly matters: family.

## Both Siblings Alive

**Rolan**: "Where in the Nine Hells have you been?"

**Lia**: "I'm sorry we got captured by *murderous lunatics.*"

**Rolan**: "I thought you were dead, you ass. Both of you!"

**Cal**: "We're all safe, Rolan - that's what matters."

### Player Intervention

**"I thought you'd be happier to see each other."**
- Rolan: "I thought my entire family was DEAD."
- Lia: "I'm sorry - we should have been here."
- Rolan: "No - no, it's not your fault. I shouldn't have shouted - I'm sorry."

**"Rolan was in a bad state without you two."**
- Rolan: "I was just... overwhelmed. It doesn't matter."

**"Getting captured was stupid and reckless."**
- Lia: "I know, all right? But I couldn't stand back and do nothing."
- Rolan: "You two did what you thought was right, but I can't go through this again. I just can't."

### Resolution (Both Alive)

**Cal**: "Thank you - for saving me. And the two idiots."

**"Don't mention it."**
- Lia: "Humble too? Imagine that."
- Rolan: "They've no cause to be humble. They brought us back together - a task I failed miserably at."

**"Anything to add, Rolan?"**
- Approval: All companions +1
- Rolan: "I've lashed out at you, drunkenly and otherwise, and you helped anyway."
- Rolan: "You didn't deserve that - I'm sorry. And thank you."

**"This is the last time I risk my life for you lot."**
- Cal: "That's more than fair. Thank you for helping us when most wouldn't."
- Rolan: "And when others, such as myself, failed miserably."

**"So, who is paying me?"**
- Approval: Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Rolan: "The beggar wants their coppers, do they? Fine by me."
- Cal: "Rolan, we're alive because of them - don't be like that."
- Rolan: "Here - take this and leave. You can go now."

## Only Cal Survives (Lia Dead)

**Rolan**: "I return from the darkness itself only to find you acting like you're on holiday. Lia could still be in Moonrise!"

**Cal**: "She's *gone,* Rolan. I saw it."

**Rolan**: "Did you even try to save Lia?"

**Cal**: "I tried to save her - I swear it! Please, Rolan."

### Player Intervention (Lia Dead)

**Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard**: "All the magic in the world could not have saved Lia. Not yours - and not mine." (Persuasion DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "Well, we'll never know, will we? Because Cal had one job - protect her. And he failed - *miserably.*"
- Cal: "Do you wish it was me who died? Instead of Lia?"
- Rolan: "Gods no, that's not what I meant. Never, Cal. Never!"
- Rolan: "Shit. I'm sorry."
- Cal: "Me too."

**Monk**: "Breathe. Think. This is no time for harsh words - you only have each other now." (Persuasion DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "And who's fault is that?"

**Standard**: "You want to blame someone for Lia's death? Blame me." (Persuasion DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "Gladly."
- Failure: Rolan: "Don't you dare. Lia was his responsibility, and he *failed* her."
- Cal: "I'm sorry, Rolan."
- Rolan: "Get out of my sight - both of you."

**Evil Cleric**: "How about I kill you both, so you can join Lia? I'll even say your last rites." (Intimidation DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "Am I supposed to pretend that everything is fine? That Lia isn't dead?"
- Failure: Rolan: "Go ahead - I'm sure death would be an improvement."

**"Don't be an arsehole, Rolan. He's your brother."** (Intimidation DC 10)
- Failure: Rolan: "He's no brother of mine."

## Only Lia Survives (Cal Dead)

**Rolan**: "I return from the darkness itself only to find you at ease while Cal lies *dead*. What in the hells did you do?"

**Lia**: "Don't you dare turn this on me, Rolan."

**Rolan**: "Did you even try to save Cal?"

**Lia**: "*Enough*. I won't say it again."

### Player Intervention (Cal Dead)

**Monk**: "You speak with grief stricken hearts, not clear minds. Peace - you need each other." (Persuasion DC 10)

**Standard**: "Lia is alive - you should be grateful." (Persuasion DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "You're right - I'm sorry. We're all we have right now."
- Lia: "I'm sorry too."
- Reward given
- Failure: Rolan: "Yes, she's alive. But at what cost?"
- Lia: "Fuck you, Rolan."
- Rolan: "Enjoy the show, did you? Get out of my sight."

**Cleric of Kelemvor**: "Peace - your brother is dead, but he is not gone. He is safe now, and at peace." (Persuasion DC 10)
- Success: Rolan: "So what? We're just supposed to carry on? Act like he never existed?"
- Lia: "Or, we could remember how brave, and kind, and smart he was - every single day. That's my plan, anyway."
- Rolan: "Mine too."
- Rolan: "Sorry for... yelling. Here - I hope this helps down the road. And thank you."

**Barbarian**: "SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU, BEFORE I FINISH WHAT KETHERIC STARTED." (Intimidation DC 10)
- Success: Leads to reconciliation

**"Shut up both of you - you're being childish."** (Intimidation DC 10)
- Same resolution path

**"Am I going to get paid or what?"**
- Approval: Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1
- Lia: "Now is *not* the time."
- Cal: "Could you give us a moment? Please?"
- Rolan: "You deserve *nothing.* You two are cowardly parasites and I am disgusted it took me this long to see. Get out of my sight."
- Cal/Lia: "Rolan, please."
- Rolan: "I said go!"

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of asking for payment and of prompting Rolan's apology.*

*Note: This scene showcases Rolan's grief manifesting as misdirected anger - a realistic portrayal of survivor's guilt and the fear of losing loved ones.
