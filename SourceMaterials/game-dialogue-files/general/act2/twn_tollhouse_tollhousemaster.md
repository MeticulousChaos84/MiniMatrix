# Gerringothe Thorm - The Toll Collector

---

In the Reithwin Tollhouse, the player encounters Gerringothe Thorm - Ketheric's sister, twisted by the curse into a monstrous creature obsessed with gold. She is a writhing mass of corpses covered in gold coins.

She greets the player with a desperate howl: "WHAT DO YOU BRING?"

When asked what she requires: "I REQUIRE GOLD."

The player can attempt to negotiate with her or simply start paying the toll. However, no matter how much gold the player gives, Gerringothe always demands more.

Players can:
- Keep paying gold (she absorbs each coin into her body)
- Point out she has enough gold ("NO - NO NO. YOU MUST PAY.")
- Ask what they get in return ("YOU CAN PASS. BUT FIRST YOU MUST PAY.")
- Use Persuasion to convince her gold has no value (hard check)
- Use Bard abilities to suggest ballads and sonnets as alternative payment

Various class options are available:
- Bards can offer entertainment
- Clerics can offer religious promises
- Rogues can be more clever about negotiations

If the player refuses to pay or runs out of gold, combat begins.

The key to defeating Gerringothe without combat is convincing her that gold has no value - this causes her to literally fall apart as the gold coins holding her together lose their binding power.
