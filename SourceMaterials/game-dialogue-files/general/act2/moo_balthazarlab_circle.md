This conversation features: Shadowheart, Gale, Ritual Circle, Narrator.

Gale finds the way Balthazar has been enchanting Moonlanterns and decides to steal some of his methodology.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Narrator:** "*Carved into the bench's rotted surface is some kind of ritual circle, its sigils half-faded. Darkness and decay hangs in the air around it.*"
- **Narrator:** "*Carved into the bench's rotted surface are strange, half-faded sigils. A magic circle of some kind, thick with darkness and decay.*"
- **Gale:** "A ritual circle... and a complex one, at that. I've seen such a construction before, in the writings of the Weavepasha of Almraiven, though his vision was not so... tainted."
- **Gale:** "The sigils are written in a curious mix of tongues - ancient Calishite, Netherese, and something else I can't quite make out. If I'm reading it correctly - it was used in the creation of Moonlanterns."
- **Gale:** "It's been mostly drained, but even now contains a powerful dose of Shadow Weave."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "What is its purpose?"
- "Is it dangerous?"
- "Destroy this foul thing, before it pollutes any further."

- "It's been mostly drained, but even now contains a powerful dose of Shadow Weave."
- "It's inert, if that's what you mean. But it still reeks of the Shadow Weave, and its polluting magic will continue to escape for as long as it lies abandoned here."
- "The discarded pixie corpses might still contain enough essence, and with one of the broken lantern casements..."
- "Yes, I think I'd be able to craft one more lantern. And with a slight modification of the casting gesture, it might be able to wield the shadows instead of repelling them..."
- "Though... Mystra's eyes may be upon me, and she'd forbid me dabbling with such magic. She'd want it destroyed. Wasted, arguably."
- "Deal with it how? I hate to pull rank, but I was once Mystra's Chosen. Destroying magic like this was my bread and butter."
- "Or did you wish to use it? I assure you - it's pointless. You'll have nothing more than a sore head and a very dissatisfied wizard to show for it."
- "Oh, charming. I hope the Shadow Weave was to blame for that little outburst of unwarranted discourtesy."
- "If you think you know best, go right ahead."
- "Some room then, if you please."
- "Not bad for a wizard who slept through his Calishite lessons, eh?"
- "Gods, you're obstinate."
- "Go ahead, then. Do your worst."
- "Not how I would have done it."
- "Really? Sometimes your lack of impetus is quite astonishing."
- "Very well. Stand back, if you please."
- "I'd advise against it - in your case, at least. No disrespect intended, but this is not your typical magic."
- "Well, it wasn't in his published archives - it was merely a sketch. He invoked Mystra's guidance on how to complete it."
- "It was a quite fascinating design, though the version created here is a strange corruption of the Weavepasha's original intent."
