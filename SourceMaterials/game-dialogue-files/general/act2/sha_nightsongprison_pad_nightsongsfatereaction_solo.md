**Starting Node:** 1

---

This Pop After Dialog (PAD) plays after resolving the Nightsong situation in the Shadowfell while solo - meaning Shadowheart was not present for the decision. Different origin characters have unique reactions based on the outcome.

**If Nightsong was killed:**

The origin character reacts to discovering the Nightsong is immortal and will resurrect angry.

**If Nightsong was sent to Moonrise:**

The character reflects on having empowered Ketheric Thorm by returning his source of immortality.

**If Nightsong was freed:**

The character celebrates gaining a powerful ally against Ketheric.

**Shadowheart as origin:**

After allowing Nightsong to be taken: "I... I failed. I let the Nightsong just be *taken*. Lady Shar... what will she do to me...?"

After freeing Nightsong: "I... what have I done? Lady Shar... what will she do to me...?"

After killing Nightsong: "It is done. Lady Shar has blessed me. But there is more of her work to be done. More of her foes to be cast down."

**Companion Interjections:**

Note: These are origin character lines (spoken when playing as that character), not companion interjections:

**Astarion** (origin, if killed Nightsong): "Well, she's definitely immortal."

**Astarion** (origin, follow-up): "Almost makes you grateful to have a vampire's immortality. I only had to come back once."

**Astarion** (origin, if sent to Moonrise): "Well, she's back with Ketheric."

**Astarion** (origin, follow-up): "I just hope the old man's true to his word."

**Astarion** (origin, if freed Nightsong): "Now, that will be a nice surprise for Ketheric."

**Astarion** (origin, follow-up): "I just hope we've done enough to take him down."

**Astarion** (origin, fallback): "What a hellish place to be locked up. It almost makes Cazador feel accommodating."

**Gale** (origin, if killed Nightsong): "Her death will be temporary, but her anger... that will be permanent."

**Gale** (origin, follow-up): "When she resurrects, she'll have no interest in helping me."

**Gale** (origin, if sent to Moonrise): "Better sent to Moonrise than left to rot down here. I hope."

**Gale** (origin, follow-up): "A dismal place for an aasimar to spend her existence. Especially with that necrotic toad for company."

**Gale** (origin, if freed Nightsong): "Finally, the heavens are on my side. Or at least, one very irritated Aasimar."

**Gale** (origin, follow-up): "Ketheric will come to regret his abuse of her powers. I'll make sure of that."

**Gale** (origin, fallback): "Nothing more to be done here."
