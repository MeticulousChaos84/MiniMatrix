This conversation features: Radija, Astarion, Disciple Z'rell, Narrator.

Dialogue with Z'rell when she's upstairs. This takes place after the execution scene, and involves Z'rell mind-melding to see how players dealt with the goblins, and testing their 'desire' to be one with the Absolute via a second mind-meld. She then gives them the mission to aid Balthazar, giving them the key to his chamber, and instructing them to find evidence of where he can be found.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Disciple Z'rell:** "The great liberator. You should go and join your goblin friends out in the curse."
- **Disciple Z'rell:** "You haven't disappointed me yet, True Soul. I hope, for your sake, you're on Balthazar's trail."
- **Disciple Z'rell:** "So why are you here instead of out there, looking for him?"
- **Disciple Z'rell:** "The goblins - tell me how they suffered."
- **Disciple Z'rell:** "No. Better yet - show me."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "Get over yourself. I have questions about our mission to find Balthazar."
- "And enjoyable. Got any more minions to punish?"
- "A child could have done it."
