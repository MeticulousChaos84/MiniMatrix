# Balthazar and Nightsong Confrontation

If Balthazar is alive when the player reaches Nightsong, they witness a confrontation between the necromancer and the imprisoned aasimar. This gives the player one final chance to betray Balthazar.

Nightsong greets Balthazar with contempt: "Balthazar. Come to add more bars to my cage."

She paces her narrow cage like a tiger, accusing the player: "Or perhaps to lead this would-be Justiciar's blade directly to my heart?"

Balthazar explains his purpose - bringing Nightsong back to General Thorm: "Aylin is so much more than that. She is an aasimar, bound to a soulcage of my creation, and lending her immortal strength to General Thorm."

He boasts: "Her power, his will, and my genius. An unsurpassable feat."

Nightsong mocks him: "Ramblings most unsane. Poor Balthazar, for maggots ate his brain long ago."

Shadowheart (companion) protests: "The Nightsong is Shar's sacrifice - she's *my destiny*. He cannot have her!"

If playing as Shadowheart (origin), Shar speaks directly: "Stop him. Nightsong must not leave. She must die by my spear, or you will have failed me."

Players can:
- Attack Balthazar to stop him taking Nightsong (+1 Lae'zel, Gale, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin)
- Let Balthazar take Nightsong to Moonrise (Shadowheart -10, Karlach -5, others -1)
- Various class-specific options (Clerics, Paladins, etc.)

If the player lets Balthazar take Nightsong, she warns: "A pleasure to have made your acquaintance, little warrior. We will meet again. I am eternal; I will be free, one day; and I never forget a face."

Shadowheart will leave the party permanently if the player allows this.
