# Raphael at the Mausoleum - The Orthon Warning

**Source:** `SHA_Raphael.html`
**Starting Node:** 73

This is a major Astarion questline dialogue. Raphael appears at the Thorm family mausoleum entrance before the player descends into the Shar Temple. He delivers a theatrical warning about the dangers below - specifically the Orthon - and offers Astarion a deal to translate his scars.

Raphael opens with a limerick:
- "Our hero thought but of treasure ahead, did not consider the peace of the dead..."
- "Through the dark he/she/they went creeping, and awoke what was sleeping..."
- "A new grave they dug, which he/she/they themselves fed."

After Karlach's sarcastic "Ooh, spooky," Raphael explains he's grown "quite fond" of the player and wants to warn them about "a creature that lurks in silence and shadow - a creature who, like me, is very much of the infernal persuasion."

Raphael warns this creature is "carnage incarnate" and advises: "Strike first. Strike true. Defy the odds, for they are distinctly in its favour. That much I owe the bastard to concede."

**The Astarion Deal:**

If Astarion is a companion (or origin), he interjects to propose a deal about his scars. He explains: "Long ago, some Infernal runes were cut into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."

Raphael teases: "It's something of great importance to your master. But is it a love letter, a warning, or a deed of ownership? I can give you all the gory details."

The deal: Kill the Orthon, and Raphael will translate the scars.

If the party hasn't seen Astarion's scars, Raphael dramatically reveals them: "You haven't told them? And you've kept your clothes on this whole time? How unlike you." He then magically removes Astarion's shirt.

When asked about the carving, Astarion reveals: "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much. It was a rough night."

Karlach can ask directly: "What are we talking here? Lemure? Pit fiend? Orthon?" Raphael responds: "Getting warmer, warmer, *hot.*"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion** (companion, when Raphael offers the deal): "Wait! Before you go, I have a proposal of my own."

**Astarion** (companion): "This is serious business, devil."

**Astarion** (companion): "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved some runes into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."

**Astarion** (companion, when Raphael removes his shirt): "Gods damn it."

**Astarion** (companion): "Yes, fine, we'll kill this damn creature of yours."

**Astarion** (companion, about the deal): "A fairer deal than I expected."

**Astarion** (companion): "What's not to like? We kill some horrible beastie, and I get what I want in return. Everyone's happy."

**Astarion** (companion): "Except the beastie."

**Astarion** (companion, after scars revealed): "Well. Now you know."

**Astarion** (companion): "I - perhaps I should have, but I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Astarion** (companion): "But what's done is done, so how about we stop discussing it and just kill this beast?"

**Astarion** (companion, about the carving): "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion** (companion): "It was a rough night."

**Astarion** (companion): "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."

**Astarion** (companion): "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

**Astarion** (companion): "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

**Astarion** (companion, if player refuses to help Raphael): "Let's not be so hasty - we might enjoy doing the devil's dirty work."

**Astarion** (companion): "And it's all for a good cause - me."

**Astarion** (origin): "How long were you skulking there, practicing that rhyme before I arrived?"

**Astarion** (origin): "Did you now? And what danger would that be?"

**Astarion** (origin): "Really? That is suspiciously fair."

**Astarion** (origin): "Speaking of my tale, I do have one thing to ask you. A proposal of sorts."

**Astarion** (origin): "Hardly, this is something else entirely."

**Astarion** (origin): "Long ago, some Infernal runes were cut into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."

**Approval:** +1 Astarion for sympathizing about the excruciating carving
