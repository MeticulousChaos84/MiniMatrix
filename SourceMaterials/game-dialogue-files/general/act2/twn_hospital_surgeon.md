In the House of Healing's operating theatre, the player discovers Malus Thorm - a twisted, monstrous surgeon corrupted by the shadow curse. He is "operating" on a human strapped to a reclining chair, teaching his Darkcloak sisters the art of "healing" through torture.

Malus speaks in a gentle, paternal voice as he instructs his students: "The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar."

He demonstrates by inserting his scalpel-fingers into the patient's nerve clusters: "See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy." The patient's screams drown out his words.

When a hesitant sister makes a superficial cut, Malus gently corrects her: "Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace."

He then acknowledges the player: "Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome."

Players can:
- Claim to be a student ("A student, yes. Do please enlighten me.")
- Demand he stop the torture ("You will stop this sick spectacle at once.")
- Claim they seek to lift the curse

Malus dismisses the notion of a curse: "A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being."

Clever players can convince the sisters to practice their surgical skills on Malus himself, or on each other, avoiding direct combat.
