This conversation features: Narrator, The Warden.

The Warden is a devout follower of the Absolute with an iron will, but also a sense of mischief. When the player approaches, she sees it as an opportunity to play with the player a little bit - like a cat with a mouse.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **The Warden:** "You. Not you. Lord Ketheric may think you pose no threat to him in your disgrace, but I know the things you've done."
- **The Warden:** "Keep your bloody thoughts to yourself and your head down."
- **The Warden:** "You set foot in our tower once. You did not leave, at least not through any door I have watch over."
- **The Warden:** "I assumed you overstayed your welcome. Little did I expect you to intrude again."
- **The Warden:** "Your name, your place was kept from all of us last time, but you were to be shown the utmost of respect."

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "How in the Hells do you know me?"
- "Please, you have to help me, I really don't know what's going on."
- "Oh, don't mind me. My brain is all but mincemeat - I'm harmless now!"
