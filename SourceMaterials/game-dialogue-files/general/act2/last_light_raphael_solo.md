**Starting Node:** 55 (standard) / 72 (raider victory) / 20 (after Nightsong freed)

---

## Overview

This is a crucial Astarion scene. If Mol is dead or absent, Raphael appears alone at Last Light Inn, looming in the corner observing everyone. During this conversation, Astarion can directly ask Raphael about the Infernal scars on his back - leading to a memorable moment where Raphael magically makes Astarion's shirt disappear to reveal the scars to the party.

## Standard Opening

**Raphael**: "It's good to see you again. I'd ask if you've made any progress with your little problem, but the tell-tale twitching of your eye is answer enough."

**Player Options:**

1. **"You again - I'm sure your arrival is simply a coincidence."**
   - Raphael: "My dear, nothing is coincidence. Mortals trifle themselves with free will, as if their betters have not moulded every potential path ahead."
   - Raphael: "No offence meant, of course. I'm sure everyone in Last Light thinks they could have changed things."

2. **"Are you following me?"**
   - Raphael: "You flatter yourself - you're not the only soul of interest in this ruin. This is Last Light, where hope hangs on by a single withered thread."

3. **"I'm fine - the last thing I need is your meddling."**
4. **Paladin**: "Wipe that smugness from your face or I'll smite it off."
   - Raphael: "You wound me. I've only tried to be a friend to you - just as to the poor souls here, where hope hangs by a single thread."
   - Raphael: "I can mend it or cut it, depending on what they ask for."

## If Player Killed Tieflings (Raider Victory)

**Raphael**: "You're the best thing for business since the Second Sundering. Countless sorry souls came running to my door after your work in the grove."

**"I'd have sent more souls your way, but I ran out of tieflings to kill."**
- Raphael: "Such a shame to end a spree before you've tired of the slaughter. But don't be disheartened."
- Raphael: "After all - here you are again, in a refuge for the haggard and weary. Plenty of clients - or victims - for both of us."

**Paladin (Evil)**: "Enjoy them while you can - I'll smite you down soon enough."

## Raphael's Tease

**Raphael**: "They're not the only ones ripe for temptation, you know. My last contract here fed me for decades."

*Note: This hints at Raphael's previous dealings in the Shadow-Cursed Lands - possibly with Ketheric's family.*

## ASTARION'S SCARS - Major Scene

If Astarion is in the party and the player hasn't already asked Raphael about the scars:

**Astarion**: "I do. I have a proposal for you."

**Raphael**: "A proposal? If you're hoping to taste my blood, little vampling, think again. It burns hotter than Wyvern Whiskey."

**Astarion**: "This is serious business, devil."

### If Player Knows About Scars Being Infernal

**Astarion**: "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved infernal runes into my back. They are a fragment of a contract. I'd like to know what the full contract says."

### If Player Doesn't Know

**Astarion**: "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved some runes into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."

## Raphael's Initial Response

**Raphael**: "Hmmm..."

**Player Options:**

1. **"What are you talking about, Astarion? What scars?"**
2. **"Don't play games Raphael. Help him out."**
3. **"This is a bad idea Astarion. We should find another way."**
4. **"I don't think he knows."**

### The Shirt Scene

If player asks what scars:

**Raphael**: "You haven't told them? And you've kept your clothes on this whole time? How unlike you."
**Raphael**: "Why not let them see? Don't be shy."

*Raphael waves his hand and Astarion's shirt magically disappears.*

**Astarion**: "Gods damn it."

### Raphael's Offer

**Raphael**: "It's something very important to your master. But is it a love letter, a warning, or a deed of ownership? I could give you all the gory details."

**Raphael**: "But of course, you'll have to do something for me first. Let me think about it and get back to you."

**Astarion**: "You'll 'get back' to me? This is important, devil. When?"

**Raphael**: "Don't worry - I'm motivated to help you. Scars often tell such wonderful stories - I think yours might be truly exquisite. I'll see you soon."

*Raphael disappears*

## After the Reveal

**Astarion**: "Well. Now you know."

**Player Options:**

1. **"Why didn't you tell me earlier? I could have helped."**
   - Astarion: "I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."
   - Astarion: "But what's done is done, so how about we stop talking about it and just get on with things?"
   - Astarion: "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

2. **"Gods... the carving must have been excruciating."**
   - Astarion: "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."
   - Astarion: "It was a rough night."

3. **"All I know is you have us doing odd jobs for a devil."**
   - Astarion: "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."
   - Astarion: "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

## After Nightsong Freed

**Raphael**: "My, my, fancy meeting you here! Little late to be traipsing around Last Light, isn't it? You've lit the fire, you've freed the angel, so shoo! Go after her!"

**"A devil encouraging me to follow an angel. Aren't you full of surprises."**
- Raphael: "Sometimes you've got to root for Team Celestial. Keeps you on your toes."

**"I need a shot of liquid courage before I go. Perhaps you'll join me."**
- Raphael: "Too parochial a setting for me, I'm afraid. I prefer my liquor served in a quivering belly button, distilled in fear and arousal."

## Other Topics

**"You were here before? Why?"**
- Raphael: "Family troubles. Not my family, of course."

**"You're not responsible for the curse, are you?"**
- Raphael: "Please, I would never leave such a mess behind. Far too much attention for so little gain."

**"Spit it out, Raphael."**
- Raphael: "At times I wonder if some other fiend swapped out your tongue with that of an ox."

## Raphael's Hint About Ketheric

**Raphael**: "I never surrender knowledge for free, but one good turn deserves another, does it not? To repay you for the souls sent my way, I offer a taste of the truth."

**Raphael**: "Ketheric Thorm - proud father, man of faith, utter fool. On the night the Harpers sealed him away, someone murdered his entire army in cold blood."

**Raphael**: "Now who would possibly benefit from such a massacre?"

*Note: This hints at Myrkul's involvement in the massacre of Ketheric's army - a deal that led to the Shadow Curse.*

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

**Astarion:** Multiple lines - this is his major scene:
- "I do. I have a proposal for you."
- "This is serious business, devil."
- "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved infernal runes into my back..."
- "Gods damn it." (when shirt disappears)
- "Well. Now you know."
- "I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help..."
- "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'..."
- "It was a rough night."
- "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."
- "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

*Note: This is one of the most significant Astarion moments in Act 2. It reveals the existence of his Infernal scars to the party (if not already known), establishes the deal with Raphael to decode them, and shows Astarion's vulnerability when Raphael forcibly exposes his trauma. The detail about Cazador's "needle" and working "from dusk until dawn" is particularly harrowing.*
