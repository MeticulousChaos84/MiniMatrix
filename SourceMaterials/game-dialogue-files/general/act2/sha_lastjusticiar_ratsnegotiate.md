# The Temple Rats - Negotiation

**Source:** `SHA_LastJusticiar_RatsNegotiate.html`
**Starting Node:** 4

---

After killing a third of the rats in the Shar Temple, the remaining rats begin to negotiate. Their memories converge into a single consciousness - that of Lyrthindor, the last Dark Justiciar.

The rats plead: "You kill many, but many remain. STOP. Spare our lives, or face my teeth and claws." They explain that each death "fills my head with more thoughts" - too much, too painful.

The rats offer a treasure trove in exchange for a truce. If the player asks about their nature, they explain:
- "An ordinary rat alone. But together? Something more."
- Some remember "turning away from the sun," "donning a black cloak," "plunging a blade into an innocent heart"
- They all remember one name: "Lyrthindor" - they share who he was

If the player knows about the Orthon's contract to kill Dark Justiciars, the Narrator reveals: "The rats are describing a Dark Justiciar's memories. The orthon's quarry was here all along, scattered and hidden in plain sight."

Players can:
- Accept the treasure deal (+5 Halsin, +1 Shadowheart, -1 Astarion/Lae'zel)
- Threaten to report them to the Orthon
- Refuse all deals (rats turn hostile)
- Without Speak with Animals, attempt to read their body language (DC 21 Animal Handling)

The rats explain they "should be one, long dead. Instead we are many - scurrying, hiding, surviving."
