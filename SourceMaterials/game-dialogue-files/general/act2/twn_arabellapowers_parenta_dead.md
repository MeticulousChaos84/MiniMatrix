# Arabella's Father - Speak with Dead

**Source:** `TWN_ArabellasPowers_ParentA_Dead.html`
**Starting Node:** 34

---

The player finds a tiefling corpse near the House of Healing - Arabella's father, Locke. Using Speak with Dead, they can learn about what happened to him and his family.

If the player met Arabella's parents at the Druids' Grove or if Arabella has asked them to find her parents, companions will recognize the corpse.

If the corpse was already questioned, the Narrator states: "*The corpse does not stir. It will answer no more questions.*"

Using Speak with Dead, the corpse responds to questions:

**Who are you?** "Locke... husband to Komira... father to Arabella..."

**Where is your daughter, Arabella?** "Ran... into... shadows..."

**How did you die?** "Surgeon... sisters..." (referring to Malus Thorm and the Darkcloak nurses)

**Where are you from?** "Elturel..."

**Why were you in this place?** "Zevlor... betrayed... ran... shelter..." (This reveals that Zevlor led the tieflings into an ambush)

**Where is Zevlor now?** "*The corpse remains silent. It does not know.*"
