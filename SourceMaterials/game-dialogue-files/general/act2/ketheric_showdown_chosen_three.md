## Overview

This is one of the most pivotal scenes in Act 2. Upon entering the Ketheric boss chamber in the lower Colony, players witness the three Chosen of the Dead Three - Ketheric Thorm, Lord Enver Gortash, and Orin the Red - preparing to advance their master plan. The Elder Brain is revealed, Duke Ravengard is tadpoled, and the army of the Absolute begins its march to Baldur's Gate.

## The Confrontation

**Gortash** opens aggressively: "You said it was under control."

**Ketheric** bristles: "It isn't you I answer to, Gortash."

**Karlach Origin Moment**: If Karlach is present, she (or the Narrator for Karlach avatar players) recognizes Gortash as the man who sold her to Zariel. She shouts: "Motherfucker! Gortash!"

**Orin** gleefully suggests violence: "Salute, yes, with cleavers through his blood-starved flesh. How it crawls with failure like flies on lick-wet carrion."

## The Tension

Gortash needles Ketheric about the Astral Prism and his failures. When he mentions Ketheric's daughter ("Perhaps we never should have dug your daughter up"), Ketheric nearly strikes him - but Orin instantly has a knife at his chest.

**Gortash**, amused: "The slayer against the undying one. That would be fun to see."

The Chosen display their Netherstones in unison:
- **Gortash**: "The edict of Bane." (raises gauntlet)
- **Orin**: "The lash of Bhaal." (raises dagger)
- **Ketheric**: "The testament of Myrkul." (raises chest amulet)

## The Elder Brain Revealed

The massive Elder Brain emerges from the brine pool, tentacles writhing, wearing the Crown of Karsus. The Dream Visitor observes: "An elder brain... one of the cruellest and most powerful creatures in existence, enslaved by mere mortals."

## Gale's Crisis Moment

**For Gale Avatar Players**: The Narrator describes the weight of this moment:

"The sight of the crown atop the elder brain strikes you like lightning. Never before have you beheld an artefact of such unrivalled power."

"You realise that it could change everything. Your own course. Your own life. The destiny of worlds."

"But here, in this very moment lies your chance to heed Mystra's call. This must be it: the end of the Absolute."

**Player Choices (Gale Avatar):**
1. "It's one thing to sacrifice yourself, but you will not sacrifice your friends. You will wait." - Disobeys Mystra
2. "Or the beginning of something else... You will not die today." - The orb shudders, longing. Disobeys Mystra.
3. "Obey your goddess. Detonate the orb. Destroy the Absolute." - **GAME ENDING**

**For Gale as Companion**: He struggles with the decision:

"Look at that crown. It radiates with power unlike anything I've ever seen. To have it... to hold... If only I could..."

"But I can't... This is it. I must do as Mystra commands."

**Player Responses to Companion Gale:**

1. **"You could choose me, the one who loves you."** (Partnered with Gale)
   - Gale: "I love you too. Much more than myself. More even than Mystra."
   - Gale: "Very well. Whether I condemn this world or not: I choose you."

2. **"Please, Gale. It can't end like this."** (Dating Gale)
   - Gale: "I... I have no desire to end your life, you know that."
   - Gale: "To end it... To struggle on... It is a grave choice you're making for us both."

3. **"Trust me, Gale. We'll find another way."**
   - Gale: "I do trust you. More than myself right now. Perhaps even more than Mystra."

4. **"Stand down! This isn't your decision to make."**
   - He reluctantly agrees to stand by you.

5. **"You're right... this is the end of ends."**
   - Gale: "One last gust of Weave. One last gale to end them all."
   - Dream Visitor screams "NO!" as everything fades to black - **GAME ENDING**

**The Explosion Ending**: If Gale detonates his orb, the Narrator describes:
- Moonrise Towers lies destroyed
- The Elder Brain is killed
- BUT the freed tadpoles will complete their transformations
- A plague of illithids descends on the Sword Coast
- "It is an ending, of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."

## Duke Ravengard's Fate

Gortash presents the Duke to the Elder Brain: "Behold, Duke Ravengard: the Absolute!"

**Ravengard** prays: "Helm preserve us..."

**Orin** whispers in his ear: "You wag your wordflap in vain, Ulderling. Once the worm holds the whip, your shredded flesh will serve us."

A tentacle unfurls, revealing a tadpole. It's pressed against his eye and wriggles out of sight.

**Wyll's Reaction**: If present, Wyll cries out "Shit, no - father!" The Narrator notes he freezes at seeing his own father seized by the Chosen.

## The March Begins

**Gortash** to Ketheric: "And Ketheric - do try not to sulk. You're supposed to be the fearsome General, come to conquer the city."

His final taunt: "And I am the hero who will save it."

The Elder Brain plane-shifts away with Gortash, Orin, and Ravengard. Its voice booms from above Moonrise: "It is time, faithful ones. March on Baldur's Gate. We go to prepare the way."
