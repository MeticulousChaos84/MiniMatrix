This conversation features: The Warden, Lia, Nimble, Danis, Narrator, Lakrissa, Cal, Wulbren Bongle, Nickels.

After Wulbren instigates the escape any escaping prisoners try to make it to the boat and flee Moonrise. This dialogue covers the case in which the boat leaves without the player or joins them in the escape.

**Key Dialogue Excerpts:**
- **Lia:** "Right, boat's good to go - or as good as it can get, at least."
- **Lia:** "What I do need though, is a destination. You mentioned somewhere earlier, Last Light was it?"
- **Lia:** "This curse doesn't stretch much further than the shore. We'll hide out on the water, plan our next move from there."
- **Lakrissa:** "The boat's good to go - at least, I think it is. I'm no sailor."
- **Lakrissa:** "You mentioned somewhere earlier - Last Light was it? How do we get there?"

**Sample Player Choices:**
- "Let's go there together - I'll show you the way."
- "It's to the east - you'll be safe there."
- "Wait for me!"
