## Overview

Mattis is a young tiefling boy who dreams of opening his own shop in Baldur's Gate. He's delighted to be put in charge of the "shop" at Last Light Inn by Mol and does his best to sound grown-up and professional - though he fumbles it a bit. He has a mysterious silver key that players can acquire through various means.

## First Meeting

**Mattis**: "Check it out - we've gone *legitimate,* and Mol put *me* in charge. Whaddya need?"

## Return Visits

Various greetings depending on state:
- "Welcome back. Are you, ahem, looking for something in particular?"
- "What're you looking for?"
- "What can I get you?"
- "In the market for something special?"

## The Silver Key

**"You got any stock for an extra special customer like me?"**
- Mattis: "Hmm. I'm not supposed to mention it to anyone, but I do have something pretty special in stock. A *key.*"
- Mattis: "What does it look like? What does it open? What treasures await behind its lock? That's for one lucky buyer to find out."
- Mattis: "Mol gave it to me, said I shouldn't let it go to just *any* old jack-a-day."

**"Mol mentioned some 'silver junk' she'd found?"**
- Same key introduction

## Buying the Key

**"I'd like to buy it from you."**
- Mattis: "This is a, ahem, *valuable* piece, so it's gonna cost a lot. And that is non-negot... non... the price isn't changing!"

**"That's way too little. Here. Keep the change."** (overpaying)
- Approval: Karlach +1, Gale +1, Wyll +1, Halsin +1
- Disapproval: Lae'zel -1
- Mattis: "Are you serious? Thanks so much! I've gotta tell Mol."

**"You drive a hard bargain, but it's a deal."**
- Mattis: "Yes! That's my first *negotiation*. Here. Pleasure doing business with you."
- OR: "Oh no! I'm so sorry, I - I think I dropped it. This is so unprofessional, Mol is gonna kill me!"

**"No chance. That's too much."**
- Mattis: "As Mol would say - suit yourself."

**"I'll be back with the money."**
- Mattis: "Better hurry, I've got *loads* of interested parties."
- On return: "Sure..." (rolling eyes)

## Deceiving Mattis

**"Mol said I could have it."** (Deception DC 14)
- Success: Mattis: "No she didn't."
  - **"Yes she did."** (Deception DC 6)
    - Success: Mattis: "Really? But she said... all right. Here. I guess."
  - **"Yuh-huh."** (DC 6)
    - Success: Mattis: "Ugh. *Fine.*"
    - Failure: Mattis: "Nuh-uh!"
  - **"Give it or I'm telling Mol on you."** (Intimidation DC 6)
    - Success: Gives key
    - Failure: Mattis: "Go ahead! It's *mine*. Got it?!"
- Failure: Mattis: "Until she tells me that herself, I'm gonna hang onto it. Thanks."

## Persuading Mattis

**"If it was worth any coin, do you think Mol would have given it to you?"** (Persuasion DC 14)
- Success: Mattis: "I mean... *maybe.*"
  - **"Hand it over. *Now.*"** (Intimidation DC 6)
    - Success: Mattis: "But she put me in charge of the shop! I thought... never mind. Here. You can have it, then."
  - **"Mol knows it'll be safer with me - and so do you."** (Persuasion DC 6)
    - Success: Gets key
  - **"With all the other fabulous things you've found in this inn, why hold on to a dusty old key?"** (Insight DC 6)
    - Success: Mattis: "Hm. I guess it is kind of old. Here. Birds of a feather."
    - Failure: Mattis: "Cause it's *mine*. Got it?"
  - **Rogue**: "Look - give it to me now, or I steal it later. The former is less embarrassing." (Persuasion DC 6)
    - Success: Gets key
- Failure: Mattis: "She always says the stuff I like is junk. I'm gonna make a killing on this! You'll see."

**"Take good care of that key."**
- Mattis: "Don't worry - it isn't leaving my sight!"

## Happy Face Comment

**"Yours is the first happy face I've seen in a good while."**
- Mattis: "I'm alive, ain't I? What's not to like."

## Alert State (After Spy Discovery)

**Mattis**: "Mol said never abandon your post, so I'm gonna keep the shop going. What do you need?"

**If player promised to save Mol**: "Mol can be cranky, and mean, but she looks after us. So, stock up, all right? 'Cause you need all the help you can get to bring her home."

## After Tieflings Rescued from Moonrise

**Mattis**: "Thanks for bringing the crew back. If I open a shop in Baldur's Gate you're gonna get a discount! Not, like, a big one, but still."

**Subsequent visits**: "I can't wait to get outta this dump and never come back. Grab what you can before we scarper, yeah?"

## After Nightsong Freed

**Mattis**: "You had something to do with the light, right? I *knew* it - this is the end for Ketheric. Stock up while you can!"

**Subsequent visits**: "My stores are always open to you - just make sure you give Ketheric a few knocks from me, yeah?"

## After Tiefling Prisoners Die

**Mattis**: "I want to go back. Back to the way things were... What can I get you?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of overpaying for the key, disapproves of intimidating the child.*

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Generally neutral on the interactions with Mattis.*

*Note: Mattis represents childhood resilience and optimism even in dire circumstances. His dream of opening a shop in Baldur's Gate and his attempts to sound professional ("non-negot... non...") provide comic relief while also showing how the tiefling children are trying to make the best of their situation. The silver key he sells is an actual useful item in the game.*
