# Last Light Inn - His Majesty the Cat

**Source:** `HAV_Cat.html`
**Starting Node:** 29 (first meeting with Speak with Animals) / 89 (without)

---

## Overview

His Majesty is a perpetually grumpy cat found near Barcus's workshop at Last Light Inn. With Speak with Animals active, players can have a hilariously confrontational conversation with this territorial feline who has exactly zero patience for visitors. Despite his hostility, he offers a surprisingly useful warning: don't trust the cleric (Isobel).

## First Encounter (With Speak with Animals)

**His Majesty**: "Hiss! I say: *HISS!*"

**Ranger Insight**: *"Your years of hunting and tracking have taught you to recognise a territorial animal when you see it."*

## Territorial Dispute

**His Majesty**: "This is my territory. And *you're* in it."

**Player Options:**

1. **"Apologies. I'll keep my distance."**
   - His Majesty: "Indeed, you will. Or you'll find my claws planted firmly in your dangles."

2. **"My intentions are pure. I only wanted to admire you up close."**
   - Approval: Shadowheart +2, Astarion +1, Gale +1, Wyll +1, Karlach +1, Halsin +1, Minthara +1
   - Disapproval: Lae'zel -1
   - His Majesty: "Hmm. I'll allow it."

3. **"Hiss!"** (Intimidation DC 14)
   - Success: His Majesty: "I see. Yes, perhaps you're right."
   - Failure: His Majesty: "*RIAOW!*"

4. **Ranger Option**: "I do not seek your territory, noble beast, only a few moments of your time." (Animal Handling DC 10)
   - Success leads to admiration path

5. **"Barcus is permitted and I'm not?"**
   - His Majesty: "*Precisely!*"

## If Permitted to Stay

After flattering or intimidating the cat successfully:

**"How did you come to this place?"**
- His Majesty: "I slinked, of course." / "It was quite straightforward. I *slinked.*"

**"What's your name?"**
- His Majesty: "I call myself *His Majesty.*"

**"I could use someone like you in my camp. Care to join?"**
- His Majesty: "I'd rather die."

## The Warning About Isobel

**"Heard anything interesting around here?"** / **"You seem like someone who knows what he's about."**

His Majesty: "Good of you to notice. For my part, *I* have noticed the cleric is a liar."

"She promised me a bit of milk. But do you see any milk? Do you? Nor do I. Disgraceful."

*Note: While this seems like a petty complaint, it's actually a clever foreshadowing. Isobel does have secrets she's hiding from the party.*

## Driving Him Away

If the player successfully intimidates him and then asserts dominance:

**"You're in my territory. Get out."**
- Approval: Lae'zel +2, Astarion +1
- Disapproval: Shadowheart -2, Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Halsin -1, Minthara -1

His Majesty: "You know, I think it's time I move somewhere better-suited to my lifestyle."

"A parting piece of advice: don't trust the cleric. She's a bounder and a cad. Much like yourself, some might say."

*Note: He then leaves into the Shadow-Cursed Lands - presumably to his death, given the dangers there.*

## Without Speak with Animals

The cat simply hisses at the player. If they attempt to pet it:

**His Majesty**: "*HISS!*"

**Player Options:**

1. **"Here, kitty kitty."** (Animal Handling DC 14)
   - Success: The cat meows warily
   - Then you can try to pet it (it hisses anyway)

2. **"WOOF!"** (Barbarian-specific)
   - The cat attacks
   - Approval: Lae'zel +2, Astarion +1
   - Disapproval: Shadowheart -2, Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Minthara -1, Halsin -1

## Dark Urge Interaction

**Dark Urge**: "MREAOW!" (hisses or growls horribly at the cat)

If dating/partnered with Astarion:
**Astarion**: "Well, at least you purr for me..."

## Lae'zel's Commentary

If the cat hisses and runs off:
**Lae'zel**: "*Chk*. Why would anyone keep such neurotic creatures as pets?"

## Context-Sensitive Lines

**During Siege**: "This place is under attack!"
- His Majesty: "*You'll* be under attack if you don't heed my hiss!"

**After Isobel Removed**: "You should get out of here - this place is vulnerable to the shadow curse."
- His Majesty: "Aw, is the little kitten afraid of some shadows? PATHETIC!"

**After Nightsong Freed**: "Would that I lived on an island, far away, all alone..."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** *No spoken lines in this scene. Approves (+1) of flattering the cat, disapproves (-1) of driving it away.*

**Astarion:** Has one spoken line when Dark Urge growls at the cat (if dating/partnered): "Well, at least you purr for me..."
*Also approves (+1) of flattering the cat and driving it away.*

**Lae'zel:** "*Chk*. Why would anyone keep such neurotic creatures as pets?" (when the cat runs off)

*Note: His Majesty is a delightful bit of comic relief, but his warning about Isobel being a "liar" is actually meaningful - she's hiding her connection to Ketheric Thorm (her father) from the party.*
