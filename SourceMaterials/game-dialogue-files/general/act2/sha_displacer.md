# The Displacer Beast - A Toxic Romance

**Source:** `SHA_Displacer.html`
**Starting Node:** 118

---

The player attempts to speak with a Displacer Beast in the Orthon's lair. This encounter requires Speak with Animals to have meaningful dialogue. The beast guards what it calls its "master's den."

The displacer has been charmed by eating poisoned spider meat from the Orthon. It claims to be the Orthon's "heart-chosen" and "love" - defending this bizarre relationship even when questioned. The beast describes being found starving and fed by its master, then somehow falling in love (though it can't quite remember how).

Players can:
- Deceive the beast that the Orthon sold it (DC 16 Deception) - if successful, the beast becomes enraged
- Persuade it that the meat is drugged (DC 16 Persuasion) - awakens buried memories
- Recruit it to fight the Orthon (DC 30 Persuasion after breaking the charm)
- Mock the relationship (risk Constitution check to stifle laughter, or face combat)
- Use Animal Handling to study its behavior and realize it's in love

If the player cured the beast's charm with magic beforehand, it feels strange and "clear" and will help fight the Orthon.

The dialogue includes dark humor about the beast's devotion - it describes rotting meat as gifts and kicks as "most earned." Dark Urge characters get special cynical options about love being a disease.
