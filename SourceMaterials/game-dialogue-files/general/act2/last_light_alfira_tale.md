# Last Light Inn - Alfira's Tale

**Source:** `HAV_AlfiraTale_Bard.html`
**Starting Node:** 87 (first meeting) / 88 (already knows about ambush)

---

## Overview

Alfira, the tiefling bard from the Grove, is found at Last Light Inn holding herself together after a devastating cultist ambush. She witnessed the brutal attack that resulted in many of her people being dragged to Moonrise Towers, and she asks the player to rescue the prisoners. This scene reveals how traumatized the tiefling refugees have become and sets up the Moonrise prison rescue quest.

## First Encounter

**Alfira**: "You're all right! Thank goodness, I was worried they'd got you too."

The player can respond in various ways:
- Ask what happened
- Ask how she's holding up
- Dismiss her concerns

## The Ambush Story

Alfira describes the attack:

"We were ambushed out in the darkness - by *cultists.* We surrendered, but that wasn't enough for them."

"They lined us up like dogs. Asharak was with the kids, telling them it was gonna be all right."

"Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel..."

"They took his eyes first. Then his tongue."

*Note: If Asharak died in Act 1, Ikaron takes his place in this story.*

## Rolan's Role

**Alfira**: "Rolan, of all people, saved us."

"He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here."

If the player convinced Rolan to stay in Act 1, this is the payoff - his magic saved several tieflings during the ambush.

## How Alfira Copes

When asked how she keeps going, the player has class-specific options:

**Bard**: "'When the night is dark, stars shine brightest.' So keep on shining. It's going to be all right."
- Alfira: "'Heart's Requiem', right? The hero survives a war and rebuilds her life - stronger than ever. A tale worth remembering - especially now."

**Druid**: "It helps to remember what is at stake - I fight for nature, for balance. I fight for life itself."

**Monk**: "To linger in the past is to condemn our future. Focus on the here and now."

**Rogue**: "I take what I'm due and I don't look back."

**Half-Orc**: "This anger you feel? This fear? *Use it.* Don't give in to it."
- Universal approval (+1) from all companions

## The Rescue Request

**Alfira**: "You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there."

"If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise. And gods have mercy on anyone in that hellspit."

**Player Options:**

1. **"I'll do everything in my power to save them - you have my most solemn vow."** (Paladin-specific)
   - Approval: All companions +1

2. **"Don't worry, I'll find them."**
   - Approval: All companions +1

3. **"I'm sure they're fine. Probably being held for questioning."**
   - Alfira: "Maybe. Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. You've enough on your plate."

4. **"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now."**
   - Alfira: "Why would you say something like that? What is *wrong* with you?"
   - Approval: Astarion +1, Minthara +1 / Disapproval: Others -1

## After the Rescue

If the player saves all tieflings:

**Alfira**: "You actually did it - you rescued them from Moonrise. *How?*"

Claiming to be a hero earns:
- Approval: Wyll +1, Gale +1, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Karlach +1, Halsin +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Astarion -1

**Alfira**: "By the time we get to the city, I'm gonna have an entire *catalogue* of songs about you."

If the player failed to save anyone:

**Alfira**: "They were good people - they deserved to die old and happy. Not in the hands of monsters."

## Special Interactions

**If player smashed Alfira's lute in Act 1**: "Everyone else might welcome you with open arms, but stay the hells away from me you lute-smashing arsehole."

**Running from the ambush validation**: "Running was the right call."
- Approval: Astarion +1, Gale +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Karlach +1, Halsin +1
- Disapproval: Lae'zel -1, Minthara -1

**Calling her cowardly**: "You ran? Cowardly."
- Approval: Lae'zel +1, Minthara +1
- Disapproval: Most companions -1
