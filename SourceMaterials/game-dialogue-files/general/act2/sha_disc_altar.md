# The Disc Altar - Gauntlet of Shar

**Source:** `SHA_Disc_Altar.html`
**Starting Node:** 62/39

---

The player approaches an altar dedicated to Shar in her temple. This altar serves as a call to action for the player to complete Shar's trials and become a Dark Justiciar.

When first examining the altar, the Narrator describes an inscription and a bloodstain in a bowl, calmly and willingly spilled. If Shadowheart is the player character, she recognizes this as THE Gauntlet of Shar - legendary to her faith. She becomes awed, recalling that the Dark Lady's finest warriors arose from this place.

Shadowheart explains the Dark Justiciars were the Nightsinger's most trusted warriors, and to become one, initiates had to pass trials and then make a sacrifice in Shar's innermost sanctum. The player can:

- Support Shadowheart's desire to complete the trials (+5 Shadowheart approval)
- Refuse and say it's a distraction from finding a cure (-5 Shadowheart approval, +1 from most other companions)
- Question if she's sure this is what she wants (responses vary by approval level)
- Ask what becoming a Dark Justiciar means - power to fight the Absolute

If the player is a Shar worshipper themselves, they get special dialogue options. Selune worshippers feel revulsion at the site. Players can also attempt History or Religion checks to learn about the Dark Justiciars and their trials - which test stealth, combat, and navigating sacred darkness, culminating in a Selunite sacrifice.
