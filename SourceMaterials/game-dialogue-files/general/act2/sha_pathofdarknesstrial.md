# Path of Darkness Trial - Navigate Sacred Darkness

This dialogue triggers when a player interacts with the trial statue to begin the path of darkness/invisible platform trial in the Shar Temple.

The Narrator describes: "The bowl contains an ancient, rust-coloured bloodstain. It forms a neat disc, as if spilled calmly and willingly."

If Shadowheart recognizes the trial (as origin or if she's learned about them), special narration plays: "You recognise this as a trial, where initiates would prove themselves to Lady Shar. This one would test their ability to navigate her sacred darkness."

When Shadowheart is in the party, she requests to perform the blood offering:
- First time: "This is one of Lady Shar's trials. Allow me - please."
- If already asked once: "Another trial. Allow me - please."
- If previously refused: "We're wasting time. Please, just let me do this."

Players can:
- Allow Shadowheart to proceed (+5 approval) - she cuts her hand with a dagger
- Refuse her request (-1 approval)

If refused with high approval, Shadowheart responds: "Seems your determined to put our mutual trust to the test. Pity."

If refused with low approval: "I'll remember that, should you ever need something of me."

Players can also:
- Meet the statue's gaze to hear Shar's voice: "Navigate the darkness to feel my embrace."
- Offer their own blood (Shar worshippers get special text: "Offer your blood in Shar's name")
- Leave without doing the trial
