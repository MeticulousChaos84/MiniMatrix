After the player frees the Nightsong, Dame Aylin is restored to her former glory in a dramatic transformation sequence.

She invokes Selune: "Our Lady of Silver. Hear me! She Who Guides, the Moonmaiden Selune - MOTHER OF THE SO-CALLED NIGHTSONG. THE NIGHTSONG IS NO MORE!"

A moonbeam lands on her like a spotlight as she transforms. Her wounds heal, her rusted armor mends, and she is renewed in "the shining armour of a paladin of Selune."

She proclaims: "I am resplendent."

If Shadowheart freed her after the origin moment, Nightsong comments: "You have given me a great gift, little warrior. Don't you find it oh-so-curious that you would spurn your Dark Lady? Perhaps you feel a stirring of the truth already."

Nightsong thanks the player: "You have done what we feared was impossible. You have released me from a century of sorrow."

She bestows a reward: "Your power is great. So too must be your weapon. You must choose what you will wield. And the Moonmaiden will provide. Thus I have said; thus will it be so."

When asked if the player is ready, players can respond:
- "Ready for what?" - Nightsong answers: "To kill Ketheric Thorm."
- "To get out of this place? Absolutely." - "Ho! We'll do more than that, my friend."
- "For my weapon? Naturally." - "Ho! And it shall be yours."

Shadowheart (as companion after freeing Nightsong) worries: "We need to leave. Lady Shar won't stand for us to be here - not after what we did... Let's get out of here, please. Whatever's coming, I don't want to be in the heart of the Shadowfell when it finds me."

Shadowheart (as origin after freeing Nightsong) receives narration: "A shudder of fear runs through you. Lady Shar asked you to prove yourself - and you failed. Yet no pain, no recrimination. Only silence. And somehow, this strikes you as worse."
