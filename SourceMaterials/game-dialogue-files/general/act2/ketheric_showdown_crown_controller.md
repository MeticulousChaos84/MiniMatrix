## Overview

After defeating Ketheric Thorm, players loot the Netherstone (Crown Controller) from his body. The Dream Visitor emerges from the Astral Prism to explain the significance of what they've witnessed - the nature of the Absolute, the Netherstones, and the threat facing Baldur's Gate.

## The Netherstone

The Narrator describes: "In death, the body is cooling, but energy radiates from the stone."

The Dream Visitor appears through a portal (temporarily able to leave the Prism since the Elder Brain's influence is weakened). Their reaction varies by personality track:

- **Desire Track**: "Remarkable. Truly."
- **Reason Track**: "You did well. Really well."
- **Fear Track**: "So it is accomplished. The first step."

## The Truth About the Absolute

The Dream Visitor reveals the full picture:

"The Absolute is neither god nor man. It is the elder brain you saw, held here by those three against its will."

"The crown it wears controls it, and these stones control the crown. It has been dominated."

"To master an elder brain... to subdue it... Our enemies are formidable."

## The Crown's Origin

If the player (or Gale) asks about the Crown:

"The crown's markings suggest it was forged in Netheril, an ancient empire whose mastery over magic rivalled that of the gods."

"It is a crown of domination. The stones were taken from its crest. They are Netherstones, imbued with the ability to control the wearer of the crown."

"The crown's Netherese magic must be the true source of the parasites' abilities. This must be what elevates their potential."

## Understanding the Failed Cure

For players who sought cures from Nettie, Halsin, Auntie Ethel, or Omeluum:

"And it must be the reason nobody could heal you."

"If the crown can do this to the parasites, I dare not imagine what it is doing to the brain."

## The Dead Three

The Dream Visitor identifies the enemies:

"One of them I know. Lord Enver Gortash - an arms dealer and a slaver. A worshipper of Bane, the god of tyranny."

"The other is a mystery to me. But the way she spoke, it is most likely she follows Bhaal - god of murder."

"Ketheric was a follower of Myrkul. Which means the Absolute is a front for the gods of death and our enemies are the Chosen of the Dead Three."

"Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. The tyrant, the assassin, and the necromancer."

"They are known to pick from their most devout followers a Chosen, granting them incredible powers."

"Each one alone would be a formidable enemy. But working together, and controlling an elder brain..."

"I dare not imagine what they might achieve."

## The Path Forward

**"What do we do now?"**

"We prepare for the fight of our lives, and the lives of everyone in Faerûn."

"The army of the Absolute is marching on Baldur's Gate."

"Within the city, an elder brain brimming with power, ready to turn everyone within its reach into mind flayers. All it needs is an order."

"An order the death gods' Chosen are on the cusp of giving."

"We must wrest control of the brain from the Chosen before that happens - we must take their stones."

"Our chances of success are slim, but we must not fail. If we fail, everything ends."

"I will be your shield, but you must be the sword."

"And when the chance to strike comes, you must take it. For there may only be one chance."

## Optional Player Responses

**"What hope do we have if the gods themselves are involved?"**
- "Hope is a luxury for those who have a choice."

**"I didn't come here to fight gods - I just want my parasite removed."**
- Desire Track: "I know. But this is the only way."
- Reason Track: "I know. But the path to one lies through the other."
- Fear Track: "Are you so blind to what's at stake?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** Has multiple reactions to learning about Netherese magic:
- "Whoever controls the crown could reshape the world... if they can control it." (if he already knows about the Crown of Karsus)
- "Netherese power like nothing anyone's seen in ages. They say magic led to the destruction of Netheril itself..." (if he's reacted to the Elder Brain)
- "Netherese? These Chosen are powerful indeed to have such magic in their command."

**Astarion:** *No spoken lines in this scene.*

*Note: This scene is primarily exposition from the Dream Visitor, with Gale's comments reflecting his wizard's understanding of the ancient magical power at play.*
