# Colony Kitchen - Chop the Butcher

**Source:** `COL_Kitchen_Butcher.html`
**Starting Node:** 51 (first meeting) / 44 (return)

---

## Overview

In the Colony's kitchen/morgue area, players encounter Chop - a thrall whose mind has been completely hollowed out by the illithids. He processes bodies for the hivemind, extracting brains to create intellect devourers. His broken speech and vacant demeanor make him one of the most disturbing characters in the game, yet he still retains enough self-awareness to beg for death.

## First Encounter

**Chop**: "..."

The Narrator observes: "No will sparks behind his eyes. His mind has been hollowed out, to better echo the commands of the collective."

For infected characters: "You could kill it, end its miserable life of enslavement. Surely that would be the humane thing to do..."

"Or you could take advantage of its vulnerability and plunder what's left of its hollow mind for anything that could serve you."

## Reading His Mind (ILLITHID)

Using your tadpole powers to enter his thoughts (uses daily tadpole charge):

"Pliant as well-worn boots, his mind turns to his work. Chop. Cut. Sort."

"Shiver of impact. Crack of bone. He removes the brains, digs free the squirming tadpoles. The unworthy ones, given over to the illithids. To become."

## The Work

**"What is this place?"**
- Chop: "Nur. Sery. Here. They become."

**"What did you do to all these people?"**
- Chop: "Chop. Chop. Help them. Become?"

**"Become what?"**
- Chop: "Part of One Mind. Four little feet. Dancing. To same song."
- Narrator: "With a lurch, you realise he means the intellect devourers. Here the brains are harvested - made part of the hivemind."

## Finding Us

If the player saved Us from the Nautiloid and it survived to the Colony, Chop mentions it:

"But there is one. Little. Kitty. Dances. To another song."

"Same. Song. As you?" (if player is infected)

**"Where can I find this 'Little Kitty'?"**
- Chop: "Locked. Up. Bad kitty. Thinks it is. Other."

## Freeing Us

If the player has met Us in the Colony:

**"About the creature in the cage..."**
- Chop: "Bad kitty. Sings wrong song. Must-fix."

**"What's wrong with it?"**
- Chop: "Odd. Other. Beyond One Mind."
- Chop: "Cut. Chop. Until it is us again."

**Options to free Us:**

1. **"Let it come with me. We sing the same song."** (ILLITHID, Wisdom DC 14)
   - Success: "...Yes. Yes. I hear. Go then. Make. Happy? Careful petting. Sticky."
   - Failure: "No. No. Wrong song. OTHER. WRONG SONG!" (attacks)
   - Approval: Karlach +1 / Disapproval: Lae'zel -1

2. **"I'll take the creature with me."** (Persuasion DC 14)
   - Success: "...Yes. Yes. Take - only One song remains."
   - Failure: "No. No. Must-fix. MUST-FIX!" (attacks)
   - Approval: Karlach +1 / Disapproval: Lae'zel -1

3. **"Free the creature or I'll kill you."** (Intimidation DC 18)
   - Success: "No. No. Kitties good. Sing One song. Take other. Away!"
   - Failure: "Kill? Cut? Chop? No. NO. I CHOP!" (attacks)
   - Approval: Karlach +1 / Disapproval: Lae'zel -1

4. **"Do as you will with it."** - Leaves Us to its fate

## Finding Ketheric

**"I need to find your master - Ketheric."**

Chop becomes almost lucid - his only emotive moment: "Mas. Ter? No."

Then, breathlessly, almost sobbing: "Down. Deep. One of Three. One of Three."

## The Mercy Kill

**"Why don't I send you to join all these creatures you butchered?"**

Chop's response is heartbreaking: "..."

Then: "Yes. Yes. Please."

This option has approvals: Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll +1, Minthara +1, Halsin +1
