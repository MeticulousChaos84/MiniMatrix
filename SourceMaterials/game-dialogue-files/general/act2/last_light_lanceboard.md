## Overview

The player encounters Mol and Raphael playing a game of lanceboard (Forgotten Realms chess) in the tavern. The devil is clearly beating Mol, but with the player's help, she can turn the game around and win. This scene establishes Raphael's interest in Mol's soul and includes a potential major Astarion scene where he asks about his scars.

## Trigger

Walk up to Mol and Raphael in the tavern at Last Light Inn.

## The Game

Mol and Raphael are seated throughout the scene. The game is at a critical juncture where Mol is losing badly. The player can:
- Offer advice to help Mol win
- Stay neutral and let Mol lose
- Actively sabotage Mol's game

## Player Assistance

If the player helps Mol with strategy:

**Gale**: "*Exactly* what I was about to suggest."
- Approval: Gale +1

*This suggests the correct move to help Mol turn the game around.*

## MAJOR ASTARION SCENE - The Scars

During or after the lanceboard game, if Astarion is present and the player hasn't already asked Raphael about the scars elsewhere, this scene can trigger:

**Astarion**: "I do. I have a proposal for you."

**Raphael**: "A proposal? If you're hoping to taste my blood, little vampling, think again. It burns hotter than Wyvern Whiskey."

**Astarion**: "This is serious business, devil."

Astarion explains about the infernal runes carved into his back, leading to Raphael's dramatic reveal:

*Raphael waves his hand and Astarion's shirt magically disappears.*

**Astarion**: "Gods damn it."

After Raphael leaves:

**Astarion**: "Well. Now you know."

**If player asks why he didn't tell them earlier:**
- Astarion: "I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."
- Astarion: "But what's done is done, so how about we stop talking about it and just get on with things?"
- Astarion: "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

**If player shows sympathy for the pain:**
- Astarion: "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."
- Astarion: "It was a rough night."

**If player is dismissive:**
- Astarion: "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."
- Astarion: "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

After Raphael promises to interpret the scars:

**Astarion**: "You'll 'get back' to me? This is important, devil. When?"

## Resolution

Raphael teleports out of his seat at the end. Mol either:
- Celebrates her victory (if player helped)
- Curses her loss (if she lost)
- Moves to a corner to consider Raphael's offer

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "*Exactly* what I was about to suggest." (when player offers good strategy)
- Approval: Gale +1

**Astarion:** Multiple lines (if scars scene triggers):
- "I do. I have a proposal for you."
- "This is serious business, devil."
- "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved infernal runes into my back..."
- "Gods damn it."
- "Well. Now you know."
- "I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help..."
- "Although I should probably get dressed first..."
- "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn..."
- "It was a rough night."
- "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."
- "You'll 'get back' to me? This is important, devil. When?"

*Note: This scene serves multiple purposes: it establishes Raphael's manipulative interest in Mol (setting up potential Act 3 consequences), allows the player to help Mol win through strategic thinking, and can trigger one of Astarion's most significant character moments - the reveal of his Infernal scars. The detail about Cazador's "needle" and the torture lasting "from dusk until dawn" is particularly harrowing.*
