**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:**
- "They're dead. Z'rell will want to hear of this."
- "Z'rell won't be pleased about this - she strikes me as the type to enjoy a little bloodshed."
- "I'd reconsider. He's not exactly open to attack just now."

**Astarion:**
- "Done, nice and neat. Now, let's report to the lovely Z'rell."
- "Mercy? You showed goblins mercy? The half-orc won't like this."
- "I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure this is the time or the place."
