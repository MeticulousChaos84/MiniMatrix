Klaus and his ghoul Benji guard the entrance to the Circus of the Last Days, an extraplanar circus that has appeared in Wyrm's Crossing. Benji sniffs customers to check for murderers due to recent killings in the area.

**The Scene:**
The player approaches the circus entrance where a ghoul is sniffing arriving customers.

Benji: "*Sniff.* STINKS of CHEESE. *Sniff.* Between his PIGGY TOES."

Montgomery: "How dare you! What in the hells is all of this?"

Klaus: "A necessity, good sir! The Steel Watch loves pretending sweet Rivington doesn't exist. So *we* have decided to protect you, dear patrons."

**Klaus's Introduction:**
"Hello, hello, and welcome to the Circus of the Last Days - the finest extraplanar circus there is!"

**Karlach's Reaction:**
Karlach: "Ah! A circus! Can we go?!"

**About the Circus:**
"We travel from plane to plane, thrilling all blessed to see us! From tempestuous djinni to belligerent redcaps - you'll find them all here."

**Archfey Warlock Option:**
*Narrator:* "*This entire place practically vibrates with a familiar, excitable magic. You feel your patron giggle from afar - it's fey magic.*"

Player: "I never pass up a chance for a bit of faerie mischief - I'd like to enter." (Approval: All companions +1)

**About the Ghoul:**
Klaus: "Oh, this is Benjamin! Say hi, Benji."
Benji: "MEAT."
Klaus: "Benji here checks all our patrons to make sure none of you are vicious murderers. Can't be too careful!"

**About the Murders:**
"You haven't heard? The Absolute's cronies have been busy chopping people up like it's going out of style."

"They won't go near us, of course - Lucretious, Bringer of Night, protects us. And even the Absolute knows better than to tangle with a necromancer."

**The Sniff Test:**
When requesting entry, Benji sniffs the player:

- **If Bloodied:** Benji: "BLOOD. TASTY BLOOD. SO DELICIOUS. AHAHAHA." - Klaus refuses entry
- **If Dirty:** Benji: "Urgh. Smells like a MUD FART." - Klaus: "I don't fancy subjecting our patrons to such a stink."
- **If Infected (Tadpole):** Benji: "Brain juice smells like PISS and IRON. NO. LIKE." - Klaus: "That's a first. Usually I'd allow you in, but in these times I can take no chances."

**Dark Urge Option:**
"I'm not a murderer, I swear on the graves of my Father's sacrificial victims!"

**Getting In After Being Rejected:**

**Persuasion (DC 15):** "I'm not a threat to you or anyone else in the circus - I swear it."
Success: Klaus: "Oh, damned if I'm not a sucker for big eyes and a heartfelt plea. Very well."
(Approval: All companions +1)

**Deception Options:**
- **Bard (DC 10):** "I've actually just been hired. Meet your new bard!"
- **Rogue (DC 10):** "I've actually just been hired. I juggle knives."
- **Monk (DC 10):** "I've actually just been hired. I do martial arts."
- **Wizard/Warlock (DC 10):** "I've actually just been hired. I do a magic show."
- **Wild Magic Sorcerer (DC 10):** "I've actually just been hired to do a magic show. Fingers crossed no one blows up this time!"
- **Draconic Sorcerer (DC 10):** "I've just been hired as a firebreather. Let's hope nothing catches light."

(Approval: All companions +1-2 for lying about being hired)

**Deception (DC 18):** "I'm a friend of Lord Gortash. I wonder what he'll say if I tell him about this..."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Karlach:** "Ah! A circus! Can we go?!"

**Approval Summary:** Most skill checks to gain entry grant +1 to all or most companions. Lying about being Gortash's friend loses approval from good-aligned companions.
