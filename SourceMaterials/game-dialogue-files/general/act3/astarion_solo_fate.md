This epilogue scene covers Astarion's fate if he is not in a romance with the player. The outcome depends heavily on choices made during his personal quest - whether he completed the Rite of Profane Ascension to become a Vampire Lord or chose to remain a spawn.

**If Astarion became a Vampire Lord:**
- He has incredible power but has sacrificed much
- His personality may have become darker and more callous
- He must decide what to do with his newfound dominion

**If Astarion remained a spawn:**
- He is free of Cazador but still vulnerable
- He faces an existence where he cannot walk in sunlight
- But he retained his humanity and the bonds with his companions

The scene explores themes of power vs. freedom, and what it truly means to be liberated from centuries of servitude.
