# Shar Grotto - Confronting Viconia Without Shadowheart

**Source:** `LOW_SharGrotto_ConfrontViconia_NoShadowheart.html`
**Starting Node:** 35

---

This dialogue occurs if the player approaches Viconia DeVir in the Shar Grotto without Shadowheart in their party. Viconia seeks the Astral Prism (the artefact Shadowheart once guarded) but cannot acquire it directly from the player.

Viconia demands the player surrender Shadowheart to her for "punishment," or face her assembled forces in combat.

**The Artefact:**
Viconia explains her motivation: "This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness."

She sent Shadowheart to retrieve the artefact, but Shadowheart failed to return with it.

**Viconia's Insecurity:**
A Perception check reveals Viconia's true fear - Shar has forced her to groom her own replacement: Shadowheart. "I will not be replaced by Shadow..."

**Jaheira and Minsc:**
If present, both have hostile exchanges with Viconia from their past encounters in the original Baldur's Gate games.

Jaheira: "You've finally found yourself a following, Mother Superior. And you only had to hollow out their heads to do it."

**Player Options:**
- Negotiate to hand over Shadowheart (companions object strongly)
- Claim the artefact is bound to you and will kill her
- Offer alliance against the Absolute
- Attack Viconia

**Companion Reactions on "Reeducation":**
When Viconia threatens to "reeducate" Shadowheart, companions react:

**Gale:** "Do not insult our intelligence. You'd *erase* her, make a blank vellum of her mind, her memories, and inscribe it with your poison."

**Astarion:** "'Reeducation' sounds an awful lot like enslavement to me."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Shadowheart is one of *us.* Betray her, and you betray us all."

**Gale:** "Do not insult our intelligence. You'd *erase* her, make a blank vellum of her mind, her memories, and inscribe it with your poison."

**Astarion:** "Sure, fine - whatever we have to say to escape this woman."

**Astarion:** "'Reeducation' sounds an awful lot like enslavement to me."
