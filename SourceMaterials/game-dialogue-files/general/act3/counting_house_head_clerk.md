The Counting House is Baldur's Gate's premier bank, and the Head Clerk is the officious gatekeeper to its vaults and services. This dialogue covers interactions with the bank's management.

The Counting House becomes important in Act 3 for:
- Accessing certain vaults
- The Stone Lord quest involving the Guild
- Retrieving important items
- Financial services

The Head Clerk is professional but may be suspicious of adventurers, especially those asking about specific vaults or making unusual requests.
