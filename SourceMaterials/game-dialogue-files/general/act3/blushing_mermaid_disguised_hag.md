The Blushing Mermaid tavern in Baldur's Gate's Lower City has a sinister secret - a hag has taken up residence there, disguised as something far more innocent.

This dialogue occurs before the hag's true nature is revealed. She may be:
- Posing as a helpful innkeeper or patron
- Offering suspicious "deals"
- Preying on desperate customers

Hags in Baldur's Gate 3 are notorious for their deceptive bargains, and this one follows the pattern - seeming helpful while hiding monstrous intentions.

The player can choose to interact with her normally or attempt to see through her disguise.
