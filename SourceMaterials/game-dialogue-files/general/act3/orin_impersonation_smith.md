Gyldro Angleiron is a crusty human male who runs the Angleiron Smithy in the center of Rivington. He usually greets potential customers in front of his establishment.

However, Orin the Red has assumed his likeness and identity to greet the unsuspecting player. This is her way of learning about the player in person, studying their mannerisms and weaknesses to tailor-make a death just for them.

The "smith" engages the player in seemingly innocent conversation about their weapons and armor needs, all while Orin takes mental notes for her murderous plans.
