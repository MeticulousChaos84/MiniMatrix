Mamzell Amira is the manager of Sharess' Caress, a high-end establishment in the Lower City. She greets visitors with keen observations about their desires, often guessing (somewhat incorrectly) that they crave "a sturdy dwarf, a leather whip."

**The Missing Escort - Finding Ffion:**

Amira is worried about her missing escort Ffion, known as the "Stern Librarian." If the player offers to help find her, Amira reveals: "Two flights up, then turn right and right again. That's Ffion's pleasure room, Elminster's Library."

If the player finds Ffion's corpse in the Flophouse, Amira mourns: "Murdered? Ye gods, the poor thing. By the Mother of Cats, I pray she didn't suffer... I'll miss that face. Hells, the regulars will miss her more."

As a reward for the information, she offers a free session with the dapper drow twins: "Talk with the drow twins in the taproom. They're legends among the regulars. Almost myths."

**Other Services:**

- **Drow twins** - "Hands of such skill they could turn stone to silk. Your body could suffer no knot they can't untangle."
- **Naoise the nymph** - Currently occupied in the Nymph's Grotto
- **Raphael** - "We are blessed to have a devil in residence at the moment... Everyone who's paid a visit looks quite changed by the experience."

If a mind flayer transformation occurs with Naoise's client, Amira pleads: "Please - don't spread word of this. Sharess' Caress lives or dies by its reputation."

**Companion Interjections:**
