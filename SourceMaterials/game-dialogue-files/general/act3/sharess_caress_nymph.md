Naoise is the nymph courtesan at Sharess' Caress who witnesses her lover/client Jara (a Flaming Fist soldier) transform into a mind flayer. The player arrives in time to defeat the creature.

Afterward, Naoise reacts to the traumatic experience and can offer to treat the player to an "emotional pick-me-up" as a reward for saving her.

**If the player accepts:**
Naoise provides comfort and companionship in appreciation for the rescue.

**The Mind Flayer Incident:**
This event is significant because it reveals that the tadpole infections have spread even to ordinary citizens in the Lower City. Jara's transformation happens suddenly during an intimate moment, shocking Naoise who had grown fond of the client.

The player can choose to:
- Accept Naoise's grateful offer
- Decline politely
- Ask questions about what happened
- Report the incident to Mamzell Amira
