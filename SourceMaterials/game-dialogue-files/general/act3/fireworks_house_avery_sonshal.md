Avery Sonshal is the tadpoled proprietor of Felogyr's Fireworks in the Lower City. He runs a legitimate fireworks shop as a front, but also supplies smokepowder to Gortash and the Gondians for their Steel Watcher production.

The dialogue opens with Avery teaching a child named Willow about firework safety ("Watch for wind direction. Put on your gloves. And alight at arm's length!"), establishing his catchphrases: "Once it's lit, you commit!" and "Browse responsibly!"

If the player is infected with a tadpole, the Narrator reveals: "*You feel an all-too-familiar squirm in the recesses of your mind. He has a tadpole.*" This triggers a mindmeld conversation where Avery recognizes them as "a fellow friend of Gortash."

Key interactions:
- Avery offers a free "special sample" (explosive grenade) to fellow tadpoled customers
- Players can use the password "Uncle Felogyr" to access the upstairs black market
- Through Deception/Intimidation checks (DC 15-18), players can extract information about his shipments to the Gondians
- If players fail to convince him they work for Gortash, he becomes suspicious and hostile

The dialogue reveals that Avery personally delivers updates to Gortash and supplies "exceptional quality" smokepowder for the Steel Watchers.

If the player successfully deceives Avery about working for Gortash:
- He reveals shipment schedules and panics about displeasing his master
