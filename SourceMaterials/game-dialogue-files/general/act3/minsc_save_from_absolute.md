# Saving Minsc from the Absolute

After knocking out the tadpole-controlled Minsc during the Stone Lord confrontation, the player can use the Help action to attempt to free him from the Absolute's influence. This requires the Astral Prism - without it, the Narrator states: "*His mind is a seething mass of rage and confusion. The Absolute's influence cannot be broken without the Astral Prism.*"

The dialogue opens with: "*Against the darkness swarming his senses, a single light glows - rage, flaring brighter every moment.*"

**The Emperor's Resistance:**
The Emperor immediately objects: "*Get rid of him.*" and "*Don't be foolish. He is too unpredictable - he will only be a hindrance to us.*"

Players must convince the Emperor to help:
- **Intimidation (DC 15):** "You will do as I command, or I will find a way without you."
- **History (DC 15):** "His chaos saved the city before. We need him."
- Or accept the Emperor's advice: "You're right. We can't risk it."

If Jaheira is alive and present, she serves as proof that the "Jaheira" Minsc killed was a doppelganger. The player can show Minsc an image of the real Jaheira: "*Counter with an image of your own: Jaheira, alive and well, your ally in the fight against the Absolute.*"

**The Critical Moment:**
"*The instant's hesitation is enough: with a sensation of terrible rending, something vast and nameless falls away from his mind.*"

Successfully freed, Minsc asks: "*You*. You saved Minsc while he danced like a mind flayer's meat-puppet. Why?"

Player response options:
- "Jaheira insisted." (if she's present)
- "There's a fight coming. I want every sword-arm I can get."
- "Because I'm infected too - I know your actions weren't your own."
- "Honestly? I'm now wondering the very same thing."

**Dark Urge Special Path:**
Dark Urge players face an additional temptation: "*This wretch has stood against your Father before - you tremble to end him, every part of your rancorous body yearns for it.*" They must choose to resist this urge to save Minsc.

If Jaheira was killed or abandoned by the player, Minsc senses this and attacks regardless.

The dialogue ends with Minsc's sudden panic as he searches for Boo: "He is... he is... *...Where is he?!*"

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale or Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*

The Emperor has extensive dialogue as the voice trying to discourage saving Minsc.
