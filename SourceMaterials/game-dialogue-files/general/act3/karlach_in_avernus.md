This dialogue covers the epilogue where Karlach chooses to return to Avernus rather than die in Faerun. Her infernal engine can only function in the hellish environment of the first layer of the Nine Hells.

This is a bittersweet ending - Karlach survives but must return to the place she fought so hard to escape. Companions who chose to accompany her (like Wyll) may appear in this epilogue.

The scene focuses on Karlach's thoughts and feelings about returning to Avernus, her hopes for eventually finding a cure, and her relationships with those who came with her.
