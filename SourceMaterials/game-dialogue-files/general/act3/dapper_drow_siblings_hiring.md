# Hiring the Dapper Drow Siblings

**Source:** `WYR_DapperDrow_SiblingsThreeWay.html`
**Starting Node:** 65

---

The player meets both dapper drow twins - Nym and Sorn Orlith - in the taproom of Sharess' Caress. The siblings offer their services as courtesans, with Sorn proudly advertising his "signature Menzoberranzan Love Trick."

The twins fled the Underdark because "men are treated like dogs by the matriarchs" there. They found that surfacers "crave the body of a Drow like a drug" and have made a comfortable life at the Caress under Mamzell Amira's protection.

If the player asks about their relationship as twins:
- They can put on shows of kissing each other, but when hired together there are usually "many other clients in the room to attend to"
- Sorn purchased an infertility enchantment when he came to the surface

The player can hire just one sibling or both. Hiring both requires bringing a romantic partner. Different companions react differently to the proposition:

**If Astarion is the partner:** "I'd like to try doing things like this again, now I'm free to find my own desires."

**If Shadowheart is the partner:** "There's an idea. If you're comfortable sharing... so am I."

**If Karlach is the partner:** She firmly declines: "A brother. And a sister. At the same time. Yeah - no. You do your thing, but that's not mine."

**If Gale is the partner:** "Well I suppose it would do no good to back out now. Let us begin this little anthropological study, if we must."

Halsin can join as a "+1" for the group if he's in an open relationship with the player, commenting: "So long as all are willing, I see no reason why we should deny ourselves..."

If played as Astarion origin and the drow ask about his past:
- "I was once in your position, in a way"
- Options to say "I try not to think about it" or "I was forced into it"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Well I suppose it would do no good to back out now. Let us begin this little anthropological study, if we must."

**Astarion:** "I'd like to try doing things like this again, now I'm free to find my own desires."

**Astarion:** "And don't worry, I'll dart out if I don't enjoy it faster than I used to run from the sun."

**Astarion:** "Consider yourself invited! Combined, we've had five hundred years to hone our talents - let's put them to bad use."

**Astarion:** "What? Really? What could they possibly offer you that I can't do better?" (if player chooses to hire both drow for themselves only)
