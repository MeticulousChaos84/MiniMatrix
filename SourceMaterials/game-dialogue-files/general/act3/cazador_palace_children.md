Deep in Cazador's Palace, the party discovers children locked in cells - victims waiting to be fed upon or worse. This is one of the most disturbing revelations in Astarion's quest, forcing him to confront the full horror of what Cazador has done.

The most devastating reveal: Astarion recognizes these children. He was the one who brought them here, following Cazador's orders. The children may even recognize him as their captor.

This dialogue forces Astarion to reckon with his past - not just as a victim, but as a perpetrator. He was a monster who lured innocents to their doom, even if he was compelled to do so.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Oh Gods, it can't be..."

**Astarion:** "Ah. Ah-hah... yes, now that you mention it, I may have done... that."

**Astarion:** "Don't look at me like that - Cazador's orders."

**Astarion:** "Quite the deviation from my usual routine, of course. Capture, not lure. I didn't bring them in with sweetrolls or anything."

**Astarion:** "I really forgot about them, felt nothing the moment I handed them over to him."
