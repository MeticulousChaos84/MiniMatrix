# Sorcerous Sundries - Aradin Outside the Shop

**Source:** `LOW_SorcerousSundries_Aradin.html`
**Starting Node:** 32

---

Aradin is yelling at Klank (Lorroakan's construct) because it's blocking the entrance to Sorcerous Sundries. He's furious about being sent on the Nightsong quest without proper warning about the dangers.

"You tell Lorroakan I went for his godsdamned Nightsong, and now *he has to pay up*."

**His Grievance:**
"Lorroakan said it'd be easy money - a smash and grab. Get in, get the Nightsong, go. Turns out his little relic was in a temple of Shar, beneath an army of goblins. Would never have taken my people in if I'd known."

"I can't bring 'em back. But I can make Lorroakan cough up."

**Player Reveals Nightsong is an Aasimar:**
"An aasimar? Hells. If I'd known, I'd have asked for more gold - kidnapping costs more than theft."

**Options:**
Players can:
- Lie about finding the Nightsong (Deception DC 15, all companions approve)
- Reveal Nightsong is at camp (all companions disapprove, triggers Aradin attacking camp)
- Say she's immortal and tough (all companions approve)
- Tell him she's dead
- Say she escaped

**If Player Lies and Fails:**
Aradin sees through it: "You're lying. Can't say I blame you. Thing's worth a fortune. Hope you hid it well, mate." (He may attack camp later)

**God Callbacks:**
If the player prayed at specific shrines in Act 1, Aradin references them:
- Tyr: "But then I started to wonder why I'd worship someone who had the power to help people, but chose not to unless they bowed before him."
- Helm: "And do you know what I got in return? One less copper."
- Tempus: "Felt like a fool. Still do."

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale or Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*

(All companions gain +1 approval for lying about the Nightsong or warning Aradin away from her)
