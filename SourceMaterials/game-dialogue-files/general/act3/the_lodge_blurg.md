Blurg is present at the Society of Brilliance Lodge if the gith massacre hasn't occurred and players previously met him in the Underdark. He's uncomfortable on the surface but dedicated to sharing his research.

**Blurg's Greetings:**
- To Underdark races: "My gloom-lit friend. I take it you were curious to see the Society of Brilliance for yourself?"
- To Githyanki: "My star-crossed friend..."
- To surface dwellers: "My surface-dwelling friend..."

**Surface Discomfort:**
"The lure of knowledge is a hard one to resist. Even where it requires us to endure discomfort."

"For example, it is quite bright up here. I had forgotten about the malady known as 'sunburn'."

**Why He's in Baldur's Gate:**
"We are required to attend the Lodge from time to time, in order to present our findings to the Society's members."

"My research partner prefers to avoid crowds, and so has remained in the Underdark to monitor our zurkhwood samples."

**His Treatise:**
"'The Underused Underdark: Applications for Zurkhwood in Unlocking the Future of Subterranean Civilisations.'"

"I may be indulging myself somewhat with its title, but I do believe our research harbours such potential."

**If Omeluum is Missing:**
"I am glad to see you well. I see your tadpole remains in its state of suspension."

"Your case has set us on quite the detour from our planned expedition work. We've thought about very little else."

About Omeluum: "Omeluum believed the answer to this riddle lay within the city walls, and held some connection to the cult of the Absolute."

"I had the distinct impression it was intentionally keeping its hypothesis from me. As though even the theory would be enough to put me in danger."

**If Player Saved Omeluum:**
"Omeluum tells me I have you to thank for its safe return."

"We know the risks when we go out into the field, but to lose my friend in such a way would have been most disheartening."

"If there's any conclusion to be drawn from this, I think it's that Omeluum and I are safest back in the Underdark."

**If Player Tells Him Omeluum Died:**
"Poor Omeluum. This is terrible news. Our research is meant for good - it should not get us killed."

"Omeluum would want me to continue its work, and I have a rudimentary understanding of its hypothesis."

**About Paper Cuts:**
When player suggests sticking to books: "I know a wizard over in Elturel who'd disagree. Incurable paper cuts are no laughing matter."

**Companion Interjections:**
