The climactic confrontation with Orin the Red, Chosen of Bhaal and granddaughter of Sarevok. She has been the shapeshifting assassin tormenting the party, wearing the faces of their friends and loved ones.

This dialogue includes:
- Orin revealing herself
- The fate of any abducted companions
- Her relationship with Bhaal and her desire to prove herself
- Options to fight, negotiate, or (for Dark Urge players) embrace the murder god

For Dark Urge players:
- Orin sees them as a rival for Bhaal's favor
- The confrontation becomes deeply personal
- They may be tempted to claim her place

The battle with Orin is one of the most significant in Act 3, determining access to one of the three Netherstones.
