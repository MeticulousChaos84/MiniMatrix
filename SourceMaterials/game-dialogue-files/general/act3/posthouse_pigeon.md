Using Speak with Animals, the player can talk to the pigeon at the Post House to find out more information regarding missing letters. The pigeon, Captain Blackbeak, points the player towards the Open Hand Temple roof.

This leads to discovering that an Aarakocra named Danthelon has been intercepting the mail, part of the larger investigation into the murders at the Open Hand Temple.

The pigeon is a helpful informant who takes their postal duties seriously and is concerned about the disruption to mail delivery caused by the letter thief.
