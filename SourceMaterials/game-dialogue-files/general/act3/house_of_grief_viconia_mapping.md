A disguised Viconia DeVir (the "Inquirer of Grief") conducts a psychological evaluation called the "Mapping of the Heart" to determine the player's "heartform." This takes place in the House of Grief, a Sharran temple disguised as a grief counseling center.

The scene is immediately unsettling - the hooded figure appears beside the player on a bench and sharply commands: "Do not look upon me."

The Inquirer asks a series of probing questions:

**Question 1: "What last caused you to shed a tear?"**
- Grief, Loneliness, A wound, An onion, A beautiful sunset, Never happened

**Question 2: "What is your unspoken desire?"**
- To run away, To indulge every hunger, To dominate, To be dominated, To be held, To bathe in wealth and power

**Question 3: "What is your greatest fear?"**
- Darkness, To be without power, Betrayal, Disease, Turning into a mind flayer, Spiders

**Question 4: "How would you spite one who wronged you?"**
- Forgive them, Slowly poison them, Challenge and humiliate publicly, Kill them, Hunt down their beloved, Fabricate a grave threat

**Question 5: "How would you feel if all burdens were lifted?"**
- Happy, Restless, Suspicious, Manifest new burdens, Lesser (burdens moulded me), Grateful to the gods

With a successful Perception check (DC 18), the Narrator reveals: "*An unfamiliar presence caresses the deepest layers of your mind. You realise she's trying to detect your thoughts.*"

Based on answers, players receive one of six "heartforms":
- **Violent Heart** - "Rage grips you. Blood inflames you."
- **Craven Heart** - "You flee when you should fight, seek to soften every hard choice."
- **Jealous Heart** - "Your wants are endless. All others are undeserving."
- **Melancholy Heart** - "A smile is a stranger upon your lips."
- **Prying Heart** - "You crave insights and secrets that are not your own."
- **False Heart** - "Deceiving as easily as others breathe."

The Inquirer then reveals herself: "I am Viconia DeVir. The House of Grief is mine."

If Jaheira and/or Minsc are present, they recognize her as an old acquaintance from previous adventures (BG1/2 callback): "Alas, I know you a little too well to follow you into a dark hole in the ground."

Viconia's response is bittersweet: "Always a pleasure to see old acquaintances. But you would be wise to not interfere in what is to come."
