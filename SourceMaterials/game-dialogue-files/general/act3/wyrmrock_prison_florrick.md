Counsellor Florrick, Duke Ravengard's loyal aide, is imprisoned in Wyrm's Rock Prison after being convicted of treason by Gortash. She awaits execution.

**Initial Encounter:**

Florrick greets the player with despair: "You're too late. It's over."

If Wyll is present, she addresses him directly, and if he's in devil form, she's shocked: "Wyll? Is that you? What curse has befallen you?" She then delivers devastating news: "Empty as a stare. Your father's a tadpole's puppet, Wyll. Nothing more."

**Florrick's Story:**

"I came seeking allies to our cause. Watchers spotted me, dragged me to Ulder Ravengard's husk... The Steel Watch happened."

She explains that Ravengard is completely under the Absolute's control, and her attempt to rally resistance was thwarted by Gortash's mechanical soldiers.

**Escape Routes:**

To free Florrick, the player needs to:
1. Open her prison cell (key is on one of the guards)
2. Help her escape via:
   - Killing all guards in the Prison, Flaming Fist Office, and one of the bridges
   - Finding a secret tunnel in the janitor's closet

If rescued, Florrick can become an ally in the final battle against the Absolute.
