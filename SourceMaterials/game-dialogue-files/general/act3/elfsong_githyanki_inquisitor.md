A Githyanki Inquisitor has come to Baldur's Gate, likely searching for information about Orpheus, Lae'zel, or the Astral Prism. The interrogation takes place at or near the Elfsong Tavern.

The Githyanki Inquisitors serve Vlaakith and hunt down traitors, deserters, and anyone who threatens the Lich Queen's rule. They're particularly interested in:
- The location of the Prism
- Lae'zel's allegiances
- Anyone who has had contact with Orpheus

The party must navigate this dangerous encounter carefully - Githyanki Inquisitors are powerful and fanatically devoted to their queen.
