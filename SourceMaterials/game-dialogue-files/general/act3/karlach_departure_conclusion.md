This nested dialogue handles Karlach's departure as her infernal engine fails. Her time is running short, and the party has only a brief window to say goodbye.

The dialogue includes reactions from companions as they notice Karlach is missing or leaving. The tone is melancholic as everyone realizes the tiefling barbarian who fought so hard for them may not survive.

If Karlach chooses to return to Avernus:
- Companions can volunteer to go with her
- Wyll may offer to accompany her to the Hells

The narrator notes: "Her time is running short, and so too is your window to say goodbye."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I think it might be time for you to find a shadier spot, my friend. If I'm not mistaken, you're beginning to burn..."

**Gale:** "What are you doing?! Stop!"

**Gale:** "No doubt she needs a moment alone with her thoughts. Who wouldn't, after all she's been through?"

**Gale:** "She's taking the long route back to camp. Her time with us is running short - no doubt she's many thoughts to get in order."

**Gale:** "We're short a tiefling - where is Karlach?"

**Astarion:** "What do you think you're doing?"

**Astarion:** "What are you doing?! Stop it!"

**Astarion:** "She must be at camp. I think she was getting a little too hot under the collar."

**Astarion:** "Hold on - we're a body short. Where's Karlach?"
