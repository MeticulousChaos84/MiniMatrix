Alfira, the tiefling bard first met at the Emerald Grove, appears at the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate. She's been working on her music and continuing her bardic training since escaping the grove.

The Elfsong Tavern is famous for its haunting music - the ghostly voice of a long-dead elven woman that sings each night. It's a fitting place for a bard like Alfira.

If Alfira survived the journey:
- She may perform at the tavern
- She offers updates on other tiefling refugees
- She can be recruited as a camp follower
- She continues to be optimistic despite everything

For Dark Urge players who killed Alfira in Act 1, this obviously won't trigger.
