Dammon, the tiefling blacksmith who has been helping with Karlach's infernal engine, appears again in Baldur's Gate. He's set up shop and continues his work as one of the few smiths capable of working with infernal materials.

In Act 3, Dammon:
- Provides the final possible repairs to Karlach's engine
- Sells high-quality equipment
- Offers his expertise on infernal machinery

This may be the last chance to stabilize Karlach's condition before the final battle. Dammon's news about the engine's prognosis is crucial to understanding Karlach's possible fates.
