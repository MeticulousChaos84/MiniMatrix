The aftermath dialogue with Kith'rak Voss after the scene where Raphael presents his deal in Sharess' Caress. This conversation can be triggered after playing through the Voss scene with Raphael.

Voss reacts to Raphael's offer of the Orphic Hammer, the artifact that could free Prince Orpheus from his imprisonment within the Astral Prism. The githyanki warrior must weigh his loyalty to Orpheus against making a deal with a devil.

The player can discuss the implications of Raphael's offer with Voss and determine whether to pursue the Hammer through a deal or by other means.
