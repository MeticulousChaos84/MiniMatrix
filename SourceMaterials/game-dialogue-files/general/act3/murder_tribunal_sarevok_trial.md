The Murder Tribunal is presided over by Sarevok Anchev and the Echoes of fallen Bhaalspawn (Amelyssan, Sendai, Illasera). Sarevok judges whether the player is worthy of becoming an "Unholy Assassin" of Bhaal.

**Dark Urge as Accepted Chosen:**
If a Dark Urge player has accepted Bhaal's command, Sarevok greets them reverently: "O Hail, true Chosen. May you bring death wherever you walk."

He explains their tribunal: "We honoured Bhaal with our deaths, but he dragged us into these husked forms, to bring the lash upon the Gate, and nurse his dread cult in its dormant years."

However, per Bhaal's law: "Two Children must not both leave a holy site alive." Sarevok attacks, hoping for release: "Even if I cannot defeat you, perhaps at last he will let me die."

**Dark Urge Who Resisted:**
If the Dark Urge rejected Bhaal: "The holy fool, who purged Bhaal's blessing and ruined their once-perfect form. Your death is a welcome offering here." Combat is immediate.

**Jaheira and Minsc Recognition:**
If Jaheira is present, Sarevok sneers: "Harper worm... the abdicating hero... your keen sense for this city has withered in your absence."

Jaheira retorts: "Does it hurt, Sarevok? To be confronted with yet another of your brood who is not so desperate for daddy's attention as you are?"

If Minsc is present, Sarevok mocks: "Man of Stone. As you stood a statue, a helpless ornament, your city warped."

Minsc responds: "While you wriggled 'neath the city's soil like the worm that you are. It will please my hamster to kill you twice, Sarevok."

**Companion Sacrifices:**
Players can offer Jaheira or Minsc as sacrifices to the tribunal: "A pleasing thing, to see these stones stained with the blood of she who disgraced my Father."

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale or Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*

Jaheira and Minsc have extensive callbacks to the original Baldur's Gate games.
