This dialogue introduces Nine-Fingers Keene, the ruthless but pragmatic leader of Baldur's Gate's Thieves' Guild. The scene opens mid-argument with her subordinate Uktar about an orphanage that failed to pay tribute.

Nine-Fingers' solution reveals her character: rather than simply withdrawing protection, she orders them to seize the building and arm any children old enough to fight - "If they protect what's mine, we'll consider that a start on what's owed." She refuses to cede any ground to the Stone Lord cult.

When the player interrupts, Nine-Fingers greets them as "the one who killed Ketheric Thorm" - establishing the player's reputation has preceded them.

**Critical Jaheira Storyline:**
If Jaheira is present, the dialogue shifts dramatically. Nine-Fingers reveals devastating news: Minsc is alive, but he's become the **Stone Lord** - the brutal gang boss terrorizing her operations. She's set an ambush to kill him.

Key revelations:
- Minsc has been infected by the Absolute and turned into a merciless killer
- The Stone Lord attacks leave "no survivors" and clear the way for the Absolute cult
- Nine-Fingers uses Jaheira's first name (Astele) - showing they have history
- She dismisses Jaheira's plea to handle it: "'We'? I see no Harpers, Jaheira. This fight's too big for you alone."

Player choices:
- "She's not alone - she has me" (+2 Jaheira approval)
- "We can handle this. Trust us" (+2 Jaheira approval)
- Attempt to attack (Nine-Fingers dismisses it as "scratching your arse")

Nine-Fingers' warning is clear: "Leave well enough alone. It would be a shame for the city to lose two of its heroes in one day."
