**Starting Node:** Various

---

Araj Oblodra, the drow blood merchant from Moonrise Towers, reappears in Baldur's Gate with her grisly wares. She remains fascinated by Astarion and offers new services and items related to blood magic.

If the player previously had Astarion bite her:
- She has been experimenting with his vampiric blood
- She offers new potions and powers
- Astarion may have complicated feelings about their previous interaction

Araj's shop in the Lower City offers:
- Blood-based potions
- Rare alchemical ingredients
- Unique items tied to hemomancy

Both Gale and Astarion have opinions about dealing with her again.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "One source of lethal explosive power in our party is quite enough. It seems ill-advised to add another."

**Astarion:** "Nor have I. No matter how hard I try."

**Astarion:** "I appreciate the thought, but I'm not the person I was the last time we met. And if she can unlock the kind of power she's promising..."

**Astarion:** "Well, hearing her out won't kill us."

**Astarion:** "Just as long as she knows who belongs to who this time."

**Astarion:** "Just a look. And if we don't like what we see, we can always kill her later."
