# Ben Golewits the Refugee Leader

General dialogue with Ben Golewits, the father of the refugee family who took up residence in Arfur's house while the merchant was away. He can be found either outside the merchant's house or at the refugee camp depending on the quest state.

Ben is a gruff but grateful man, a former hunter who "spent most of my life hunting things that'd kill you as soon as they looked at you." He's fiercely protective of his daughter Cinta and wife.

**Key Exchanges:**

If the player helped them stay, Ben warns: "You did your good deed, but Torm's still watching you - don't disappoint him now."

If the player intimidates them to leave, Ben curses: "May Torm split open that hard, blackened heart of yours some day." This breaks a Paladin of Devotion or Ancients' oath.

On being a refugee: "Same way lots of us did - trying to get away from the army of the Absolute. If you had the chance to put a roof over your family's heads after being on the run for Torm knows how long, wouldn't you?"

**Resolution Options:**
- **Persuade to leave** (DC 15) - "But... you're right. I can't risk those people getting a hold of my daughter."
- **Intimidate to leave** (DC 7-10) - Causes Paladin Oathbreaker event
- **Give gold** to relocate the family to an inn (Rogue option available)
- **Tell them they can stay** once Arfur is dealt with

If warned about the basement, Ben says: "We're much more interested in the beds and the pantry - but I'll make sure Cinta knows the basement's off-limits."
