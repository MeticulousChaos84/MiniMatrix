This is Gale's epilogue scene where he meets with Mystra, the goddess of magic, after the defeat of the Netherbrain. The tone and content depend entirely on what Gale chose to do with the Crown of Karsus.

**If Gale gave the Crown to Mystra:**
- He surrenders the Crown and the Karsite Weave
- Mystra may offer rewards or restoration
- Gale can ask to be her Chosen again
- He can even ask to be lovers once more

**If Gale kept the Crown for himself:**
- He becomes a new god
- Mystra must confront this rival to her domain

Mystra's offers to Gale include:
- Being taken to Elysium
- Returning to mortal life
- Remaining an illithid (if he became one)
- Becoming her Chosen once more

Gale's responses vary from humble acceptance to defiant ambition, depending on the player's choices throughout the game.
