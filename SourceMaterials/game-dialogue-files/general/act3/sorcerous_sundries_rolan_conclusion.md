Rolan's dialogue after the Nightsong confrontation with Lorroakan. His reaction depends on the outcome and whether his siblings survived.

**If Rolan Sided Against Lorroakan:**
"Lorroakan is dead. The bastard is *dead*."

"Lorroakan was a cruel and vicious man. By day, I'd tend the shop, but at night - he'd fire the most nonsensical questions at me. And for every one I answered 'wrong', he'd beat me."

"I could've killed him with my own two hands, but I kept thinking it was all a test. It had to be. I thought it was the price I had to pay to become a true wizard. I realise now he was just a sick, sick man."

**Rolan's New Path:**
"I see things clearly now. If I wish to master the Weave, I must do it myself. Thankfully, I have everything I need - right here." (gesturing to the tower)

"All hail Rolan, master of Ramazith's Tower!"

If siblings survived: "I'll move Cal and Lia in immediately. Lorroakan refused to let them stay here. They are going to *love* the tower."

**Rolan as Ally:**
"I wouldn't have this - the tower, my family - without you. What can I do to thank you?"

"Know this - Ramazith's Tower, and its master, are now your friends. And when the time comes, we will stand by you as allies."

**If Player Sided with Lorroakan:**
Rolan survives but becomes Lorroakan's eternal apprentice: "Seeing what Master Lorroakan is capable of, I know my place is here."

If Lorroakan dies during the fight: "We bested the Nightsong and lived. Lorroakan, however, was not so fortunate."

Rolan seizes the opportunity: "But now, I don't need him. I have the tower. I have the Nightsong."

**If Rolan Discovers Player Killed Lorroakan Without Him:**
Without his siblings: "You let my family die - and then you *kill* my master? Have you made it your personal mission to ruin my life? No more - I'll drag you through all Nine Hells *myself*."

With siblings: Player must pass Persuasion/Intimidation (DC 18) or Rolan attacks.
