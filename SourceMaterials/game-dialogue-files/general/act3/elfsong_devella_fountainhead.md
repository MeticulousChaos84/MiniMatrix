Inspector Devella, the Flaming Fist investigator working on the murder cases in Baldur's Gate, meets with the party in a private room at the Elfsong Tavern. The "Fountainhead" likely refers to a specific location or code name.

Devella has been tracking the murders plaguing the city - deaths that the party may recognize as connected to Bhaal and his followers. She needs help and information, and may be one of the few authorities willing to work with the party.

This meeting covers:
- Updates on the murder investigation
- Information about Orin and the Cult of Bhaal
- Coordination between the party and the Fist
- Evidence and leads on the serial killings

Devella is a valuable ally in understanding the political and criminal landscape of Baldur's Gate.
