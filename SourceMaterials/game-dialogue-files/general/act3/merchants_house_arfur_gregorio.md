This dialogue occurs after the initial conflict at the merchant's house in Rivington. Arfur Gregorio, a toymaker, is dealing with the aftermath of the Rivington Rats and the refugee situation.

The player can:
- Intimidate Arfur to let the refugee family stay
- Demand payment for dealing with the squatters
- Confront him about suspicious things found in his basement

**The Explosive Teddy Bear Plot:**

If the player found evidence in Arfur's basement and the refugee camp, they can confront him about the explosive toy bears he "donated." Arfur panics: "What? How? Nine Hells..."

Under pressure, he confesses: "The teddy bears were an experiment - my greatest invention. A clever little device in their chest allows them to speak. But there's more. Smokepowder, inside the device."

He reveals he collects packages from Felogyr's Fireworks in the Lower City and stuffs the bears with explosives. He claims he's being forced - "They would've killed me if I refused to rig the toys - and they're definitely going to kill me now!"

If the player pushes for who's behind the plot:
- He refuses to say directly but gives the password "Uncle Felogyr sent you" to access the fireworks shop
- If the player already knows about Gortash's involvement, Arfur confirms it: "I'm no more 'in cahoots' with Gortash than you are. Which is to say I'm just as much under his thumb as anyone else in this city."

**Resolution options:**
- Let him go free (he gives a Lower City pass as thanks)
- Take his gold and let him flee
- Send him to prison (requires persuasion/intimidation)
- Kill him for his crimes

If sent to prison, he warns: "If I'm found hanging in my cell, it'll be on your conscience."
