---

This dialogue occurs after the hag at the Blushing Mermaid reveals her true form - or is forced to reveal it. The creature drops its disguise and confronts the party as what it truly is.

The hag may:
- Attempt to bargain for her life
- Threaten the party
- Offer dark deals even in her monstrous form
- Fight to the death

The transformation reveals the grotesque reality behind the pleasant facade, and the party must decide how to deal with this predator that has been feeding on Baldur's Gate's citizens.
