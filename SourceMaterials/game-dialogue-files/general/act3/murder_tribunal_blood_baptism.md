The Baptism of Blood is the final trial to become an Unholy Assassin of Bhaal. The tribunal has abducted Valeria, the hollyphant detective, to serve as the sacrifice.

Sarevok explains: "One killing secures your rebirth as an Unholy Assassin of Bhaal - the slaughter of a celestial being. Make violence of its goodness. Spill its blood, and bathe in Bhaal's eternal rapture."

Valeria objects: "Civilian, do NOT listen to this ancient fuck. Free me at once."

**Companion Reactions:**
Each companion gets a unique reaction to the horrifying sacrifice:

**Gale:** "I never credited Bhaal with a sense of humour. This is some sick joke of his - let's not be part of it."

**Astarion:** "This is the grand sacrifice demanded by Bhaal? *This?*"

**Karlach:** "This is grim. If we can slip this without murdering a hollyphant, I'll be very glad."

**Wyll:** "Outrageous. If Bhaal demands blood, you cannot, you *must not*, be the one to spill it for him."

**Jaheira:** "Remember. We are here to find our way into Bhaal's Temple. Not to enter his service in truth."

**Minsc:** "This leathered balloon is bound. Helpless. If there must be blood spilled on this floor, Boo has some better ideas of who it should belong to."

**Minthara:** "Feisty little creature. If you hold it down, I will slice off its trunk."

**Dark Urge Options:**
Dark Urge players get particularly violent options:
- "It shall play a symphony of screams with its trumpet!"
- "To strangle it with its own trunk! Yes... *Yes*!"
- "It will make a fine pair of ivory daggers."

**Betrayal Path:**
If the player frees Valeria, the tribunal attacks. Sarevok roars: "**BETRAYER.**" The echoes condemn: "You have been *judged*. You have been found *wanting*. UNWORTHY."

**Completion:**
After bathing in the font of blood, Sarevok proclaims: "Behold Father Bhaal! Your lost child, bathed anew. Arise, Unholy Assassin!"
