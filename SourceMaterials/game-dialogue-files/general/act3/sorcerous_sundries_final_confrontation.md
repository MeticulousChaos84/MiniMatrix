The climactic confrontation between Dame Aylin (Nightsong) and Lorroakan in Ramazith's Tower, where Lorroakan intends to cage her and steal her immortality.

**Nightsong's Entrance:**
"What have we here? A magician in a tower, hiding away from the frightening world. What are you so scared of, magus? Not the Nightsong, surely - why, she's nothing but a relic to be purchased and pursued."

Rolan is shocked: "My gods! The Nightsong is a *person*?"

**Lorroakan's Pitch:**
"Dame Aylin, I have discovered a device that would allow your immortality to be shared. It would cause you no harm, no pain of any kind."

"You serve your mother Selûne, I believe. She who has blessed our realm with so many gifts. Honour her by sharing yours."

Nightsong's response: "You do not seek to share my gifts. You seek to poach them. You dare to threaten me with the same magic that held me in torment for a hundred years."

**Siding with Nightsong:**
Most companions approve (+1): Karlach, Gale, Wyll, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Halsin, Jaheira, Minsc
Disapprove (-1): Astarion, Minthara

**Siding with Lorroakan:**
Most companions disapprove (-1): Karlach, Gale, Wyll, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Halsin, Jaheira, Minsc
Approve (+1): Astarion, Minthara

**Rolan's Choice:**
Rolan's allegiance depends on whether Cal and Lia survived:
- **Both siblings alive:** "No, Master Lorroakan. I would never have assisted you if I knew you planned such horrors."
- **Siblings dead:** May side with Lorroakan unless persuaded/intimidated

Players can persuade/intimidate Rolan (DC 18-20) to turn against Lorroakan.

**Combat:**
Lorroakan summons his Myrmidons: "Myrmidons - *IMPERATUM*!"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "They say madness and genius are separated by but a hair's breadth. Perhaps the same is true of madness and stupidity."

**Astarion:** (No spoken lines in this conversation, but gains approval for siding with Lorroakan)
