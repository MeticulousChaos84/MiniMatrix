Ptaris is a githyanki youth hatched from the egg the player gave to Lady Esther. Raised artificially and subjected to "treatments" to cure his supposed evil nature, he has developed powerful psionic abilities and used them to murder everyone in the Society's basement - including his "father" Havkelaag and Esther herself.

**The Scene:**
The player emerges from a portal to find Ptaris standing over Esther's body. He challenges them about right and wrong.

**Ptaris's Opening:**
"Who are you? Another who needs to learn the difference between right and wrong?"

To Githyanki player: "You - you don't look like them. You look like me. Who are you?"

**His Identity:**
"I am not a githyanki. Do not call me that!" (frantic - associates the word with pain from his 'treatment')

"I am Ptaris. And I am good."

**What He Did:**
"Father was bad. They all were. I tried to make them better, but they were not strong enough. They lacked resolve."

"Such evil can only be cured one way. With pain. With torment. And if that does not work - with death."

**About Havkelaag:**
"Havkelaag. He brought me from the shell. Raised me quickly. Taught me to be good. But he failed me."

"He was not righteous. He was not innocent. His thoughts were impure."

**The Ptarian Code:**
"The Ptarian Code must be obeyed. This is the only way to be sure. Do you follow it?"

"It is honour. Justice. The true form of goodness we all must live by, decreed by Bahamut himself."

"You are not capable of following its teachings."

**Confronting the Player:**
If player gave Esther the egg: "I know what you did to me. I see the memory of it, right there in your head."

"You stole me from my people. Gave me to that woman. Unhatched, defenceless. You let me be brought here so father could hurt me."

"You are bad. You must be taught a lesson."

**Talking Him Down:**
Players can attempt several approaches:

- **Detect Thoughts:** Reading his mind reveals: "*I did the right thing. I followed the code. He deserved it. They all deserved it!*" followed by "*I should feel better now. Why don't I feel better?*"

- **Using conscience insight:** "You feel strange, don't you? That's your conscience. It's telling you to stop."

- **Persuasion (DC 25):** "You would have been destroyed if not for me. I saved you."

- **Barbarian Persuasion (DC 20):** "I wield my anger like a blade, but it does not rule me."

- **Warlock Persuasion (DC 20):** "I gave you what my patron gave me - a chance at something *more*."

- **Githyanki Persuasion (DC 20):** "Ungrateful *yank*. Our kin would have destroyed you if it wasn't for me."

**Successful Outcome:**
Ptaris breaks down: "Father said I lacked a conscience. He said I was a nasty, evil thing, but he could make me good. He cured me."

"I - I killed him. I killed all these people. I am no better than any of them."

"The code is flawed. And I am a monster, as he said I was. I cannot be trusted."

"What have I done...?"

**Failed Outcomes:**
"Evil can never save good. But good can cure evil. I will save you yet." (initiates combat)

"Lies. Only death can save you now." (initiates combat)

**Companion Interjections:**

**Lae'zel:** "A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like Vlaakith's, but he knows nothing of the Protocols."

**Lae'zel:** (if on Orpheus path) "A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like his kin's, but their ways are foreign."

**Lae'zel:** (after breakdown) "His mind is forever lost. Come - he is no use to us, nor my queen."

**Lae'zel:** (if on Orpheus path, after breakdown) "He is lost. A shame - he could have proved a great ally to Orpheus."

**Approval:** Gale +1 (along with most companions) for successfully talking Ptaris down from his murder spree.
