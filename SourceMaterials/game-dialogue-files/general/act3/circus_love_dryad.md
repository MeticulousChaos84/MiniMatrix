Zethino the dryad runs a "Test Your Love" game at the Circus of the Last Days, where the player can bring a companion to answer questions about them for approval bonuses.

**The Game:**
Players pay a fee to participate. Zethino then asks three questions about the companion - what makes them happiest, what they desire most, and their deepest fear.

**Zethino's Introduction:**
"Bring the one you love to me. I will look into your hearts and see if your love is eternal. Or doomed eternally."

"Ah. *Glorious*. Your bond is sweeter than nature's dew. I see you. *Know* you. But do you know one another?"

## Astarion's Test

**Zethino:** "Astarion: a tumultuous past hides behind a mirthful grin. The heart is fraught, so let us begin with the joyous. When is he happiest?"

**Question 1 - When is he happiest?**

- "I don't think he's ever been happy." (Astarion -1)
  - **Astarion:** "Excuse me? I've been happy, thank you very much."

- "When he's elbow-deep in gore." (Astarion +2)
  - **Astarion:** "Guilty as charged. Sometimes literally..."

- "He's happy right now - look at that smile!" (Astarion -1)
  - **Astarion:** "It's a grimace, sweetie. Not off to a great start."

**Zethino:** "Many things delight the heart, but only one makes it sing. Tell me, what does he desire more than anything?"

**Question 2 - What does he desire most?**

- "Me." (Astarion +2, if partnered)
  - Astarion is pleased

- "Freedom." (Astarion -1)
  - **Astarion:** "You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"

- "Revenge." (Astarion +1)
  - **Astarion:** "Oh yes. Yes please."

- "A nice, tasty rat." (Astarion -2)
  - Astarion is offended

**Zethino:** "Fear sits in the soul of all - to tame it, we must *name* it. Astarion - what is his deepest fear?"

**Question 3 - What is his deepest fear?**

- "Sharp wooden sticks." (Astarion -1)
  - Wrong answer

- "Breaking a nail." (Astarion +2)
  - **Astarion:** "Ha! Well, when you look this good..."

- "Forever feeling like a slave to someone else." (Astarion -4)
  - **Astarion:** "Really? I mean, yes, but - really? You'd tell whatever stranger just walked up and asked?"

- "Most things fear him, actually." (Astarion +1)
  - **Astarion:** "Oh I like that answer. Yes, let's go with that."

**Failure Response:**
**Astarion:** "Well, that was a disaster. Can we call time on this farce? Please?"

## Gale's Test

**Zethino:** "Gale: the learned wizard. The charming gentleman. The walking apocalypse."

**Question 1 - If the wizard were given the choice, what food would he be?**

- "A lemon meringue - tart and lightweight." (Gale -1)
  - **Gale:** "You make me sound like some preening peacock. I am not *that* bad."

- Correct answers earn approval

**Question 2 - Where does his mind go when times are hard?**

- Correct answer: **Gale:** "Bravo. That is indeed where my mind wanders to, when times are hard..."

- Wrong answer about past passions: **Gale:** "Once, perhaps. But those passions have soured."

**Question 3 - What is his deepest regret?**

- Correct answer about sacrifice: **Gale:** "Hearing it said out loud - yes, I fear it is true. Fate seems determined to make a sacrifice of me."

  **Gale:** "But perhaps fate can yet be defied..."
