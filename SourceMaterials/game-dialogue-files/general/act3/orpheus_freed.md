This dialogue occurs when Orpheus, the Githyanki Prince, is freed from his imprisonment within the Astral Prism. The party must decide how to proceed now that the one creature who could protect them from the Absolute's influence is free but potentially hostile.

Key elements:
- Orpheus's reaction to freedom after eons of imprisonment
- His relationship with Lae'zel and the githyanki
- The question of who will become the mind flayer to defeat the Netherbrain

Gale makes a significant observation here about the orb being a potential weapon against the brain - noting that it would "take one wizard to unleash a cataclysm powerful enough to tear apart the brain's very being."
