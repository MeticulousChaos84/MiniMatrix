# Naaber - The Annoying Would-Be Adventurer

Naaber is a supremely annoying NPC found at Carmen's Cosmetics Shop in Wyrm's Crossing. He's desperately trying to find his calling as an adventurer, cycling through various class aspirations with hilarious incompetence. The player encounters him attempting different "careers" - bard (singing a birthday song), monk (attempting meditation but unable to stop talking), sorcerer (claiming to feel ancient arcane power within), and paladin (swearing an oath of devotion to the player).

Each attempt fails spectacularly due to his fundamental personality flaws - he can't stop talking (ruining his monk meditation), his "arcane power" is just indigestion, and he immediately breaks his paladin oath because he's too excited to stay silent.

The dialogue rewards player patience with XP for enduring his entire routine. Class-specific options allow players to interact based on their background:
- Bards can outperform him with a Performance check
- Sorcerers can ask about his magical bloodline
- Monks can join his meditation
- Paladins can accept his oath (and Oathbreakers can command him to break it)

If the player tells Naaber to never sing again:
- All companions approve (+1), indicating universal relief

Dark Urge players get special dialogue options reflecting their unique perspective on suffering through this interaction.

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale or Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*

(However, all companions including Astarion and Gale gain +1 approval when you tell Naaber to never sing again - solidarity in suffering!)
