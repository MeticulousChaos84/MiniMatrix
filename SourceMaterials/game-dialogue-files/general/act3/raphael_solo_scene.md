Raphael offers his deal to free Orpheus in his private room at Sharess' Caress. This version occurs when Voss is either dead or not present. The devil silences the Emperor's connection to the player, noting: "I did shut out your other visitor for a while, so we can enjoy some privacy. The illithid can't hear us."

**Raphael's Offer:**

Raphael claims the player holds the key to destroying the Elder Brain: "You have the key to destroying it in the palm of your hand." When the player guesses the Astral Prism, he clarifies: "It's the one inside the Prism that you need. Not the illithid - the gith."

He offers the Orphic Hammer, an artifact capable of shattering Orpheus' chains, which he keeps in the House of Hope. In exchange, he wants the Crown of Karsus that dominates the Elder Brain.

Raphael to Lae'zel (if present): "A Crown for a Hammer. A bargain of a lifetime, Lae'zel of K'liir."

**If Gale suggests the Netherese Orb:**
Raphael dismisses it: "No, Gale. Mystra might have you believe martyrdom is the only solution. I offer you a way to survive."

**The Stakes:**
"At best, it will kill you and everyone else in this city. At worst, it will assimilate you, and you won't have enough free will left to even wish you were dead."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "The Crown of Karsus cannot be handed over to this devil. Agree to nothing."

*No Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*
