Lorroakan's initial dialogue with the player in Ramazith's Tower. He seeks the Nightsong and plans to imprison her like Ketheric did, draining her immortality for himself.

**Lorroakan's Offer:**
Lorroakan offers a substantial reward for information leading to Nightsong's capture. He will ask the player to deliver her to him.

**If Gale is in the Party:**
Lorroakan recognizes and mocks him: "My - could it be? Gale of Waterdeep, here in my tower. I'm surprised you dare show your face after Mystra cast you on the scrap heap."

Later: "Ah. I believe I recognise you. Gale of Waterdeep. Mystra's discarded lapdog, reduced to trailing after some adventurer. How you have fallen."

Gale responds: "I'm my own man. I make my own choices."

**Gale's Ambitions:**
If Gale hasn't reconciled with Mystra, he can reveal his plan: "Once we acquire it, your ambitions will be dwarfed. I will be able to stand against Mystra, and wrest her powers from her. For the betterment of *all*."

"Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Player Options:**
- Offer to help find Nightsong
- Tell Lorroakan she's dead (deceive him)
- Refuse to help
- Threaten him

**Gale:** "Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Gale:** "Nothing at all, friend. I was merely admiring your ambition."

**Gale:** "Nothing, friend. Just a little trapped wind - I'm sure you understand."

**Astarion:** "Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"

**Astarion:** "I do admire your directness, though. Quick and to the point."
