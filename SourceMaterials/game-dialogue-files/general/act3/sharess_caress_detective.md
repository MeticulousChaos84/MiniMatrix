Valeria is a hollyphant (a small celestial creature resembling a winged elephant) working as an investigator at Sharess' Caress. She is very dismissive no matter what evidence the player brings from the Open Hand Temple.

She greets repeat visits curtly: "I presume you've found something interesting to discuss, if you're interrupting me again?"

**The Murder Investigation:**

Despite the player's evidence regarding Father Lorgan's murder at the Open Hand Temple, Valeria remains skeptical and unconvinced. She has already decided that Brilgor the tiefling is guilty and is reluctant to reopen the case.

The player can present various pieces of evidence:
- The murder weapon
- Target lists suggesting a serial killer
- Testimony from speaking with corpses
- Evidence pointing to Dolor the Bhaalist

However, Valeria continues to dismiss or downplay each piece of evidence, frustrating the player's attempts to prove Brilgor's innocence. Her stubbornness represents the difficulty of challenging the official narrative in Baldur's Gate.
