The main dialogue with Wulbren Bongle in the gnomes' hideout cellar beneath a smithy in Rivington. If the player rescued Wulbren from Moonrise Towers, he has established a base of operations for the Ironhand Gnomes here.

**The Quest - Destroy the Gondian Workshop:**

Wulbren asks the player to destroy the Gondian workshop in the Lower City where the Steel Watchers are manufactured. He believes the Gondians are traitors to gnome-kind for building Gortash's mechanical enforcers.

He explains: "The Gondians sold their souls to build those metal monsters. They need to be stopped - permanently."

**Conflict with the Gondians:**

The player must choose between:
- Helping Wulbren destroy the foundry (and potentially killing Gondian workers)
- Protecting the Gondians and finding another way
- Finding a compromise that saves both groups

This questline represents a significant moral choice about collateral damage in the fight against Gortash's regime. The Gondians are working under duress (their families are held hostage), while Wulbren sees only collaborators.
