Behind the Big Barn at the refugee camp, the player meets a seemingly friendly Flaming Fist guard who engages them in conversation about the tensions between refugees and Baldurians. This is actually Orin the Red testing the player's willingness to commit violence.

The "guard" begins pleasantly: "Hail, friend. Fine day, isn't it? ... Is this your first time in Baldur's Gate?"

**Building Tension:**

He explains the conflict: "Some well-to-do's in the city donated enough to see the newcomers right for the time being. Only they didn't bother helping everyone else... Locals going without while strangers feast - it's stoked the fire, all right."

The conversation becomes darker: "If I wasn't wearing this uniform, I'd walk round there and teach them a lesson they'd never forget."

**The Test - Kill the Refugees:**

When the player agrees with the guard's sentiment, he proposes: "We need to march round the front, and kill every last one of them. Let's see them eat our food with their guts on the floor. What do you say?"

**If the player refuses:**
"They're innocent people. You can't just kill them!" (Karlach +1, Wyll +1, Gale +1, Shadowheart +1, Astarion -1, Halsin +1, Minsc +1, Jaheira +1)

The guard responds: "Why does it matter? Innocence makes the blood run clearer." - Then transforms into Orin.

**When Orin Reveals Herself:**

To the Dark Urge who agreed: "Yours is a crude and clumsy violence, sibling. You'll hack a jagged path through this city to reach me."

To non-Dark Urge: "Have you come beg-begging, sniffing for our stones? Gortash won't like that. A throat his black hand can't choke the spit from."

If the player agreed to kill: "He will tremble at your slaughter. So eager to spill the guts from this city."
