Mystic Carrion is a mummy lord posing as a spirit medium in Baldur's Gate's Lower City. He serves the city's wealthy elite, bridging "the void between the living and the unliving."

If the player killed his undead staff upstairs, Carrion is unfazed: "In a city like this, reeking with the desperation of the damned, they are not difficult to replace."

**Oskar's Possession:**
Carrion reveals he helped Oskar contact "a tormented spirit" but takes no responsibility for the consequences: "I gave him exactly what he desired, and for a pittance, given the complexity of his request. His inability to follow *simple* instructions is hardly my fault."

When asked how to help Oskar: "It's quite simple. He requires an exorcism."

**The Deal:**
Carrion offers to provide a Torch of Revocation for the exorcism, but demands a task first: find and return his escaped zombie servant Thrumbo.

"He was always a simple, contented creature - a beggar to the bone. Perhaps he has forgotten how ungenerous the world can be."

Players can:
- Accept the quest to hunt Thrumbo
- Pay a large sum of gold to skip the task
- Refuse and fight Carrion (he keeps resurrecting until his canopic jar inside Thrumbo is destroyed)

**Necromancy of Thay:**
Players carrying the unread Necromancy of Thay can participate in a seance to learn how to open it. Carrion dismisses basic Speak with Dead magic as "a brief and superficial incantation, cast by only the crudest of magicians."
