Dribbles the Clown (actually a doppelganger who stole the identity of the famous clown) is on a stage with Buddy the dog beside him. A large crowd looks on. Dribbles invites the player on stage, leading to a confrontation when Buddy attacks.

**The Scene:**
The player approaches a large crowd gathered before a stage. Dribbles performs his act and calls for a volunteer.

**Player Options:**
1. Approach the stage yourself
2. Tell a companion to get up on stage
3. Refuse - in which case a fan will volunteer

At the end of the scene, Buddy the dog attempts to sneak up on whoever is on stage and attacks.
