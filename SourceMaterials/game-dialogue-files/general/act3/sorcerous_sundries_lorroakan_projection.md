Lorroakan's magical projection serves as Sorcerous Sundries' clerk when Rolan is dead. It functions like an automated customer service system with pre-recorded messages.

"Welcome, dear patron, to Sorcerous Sundries. I am an un-person in service of the revered wizard Lorroakan, proprietor of this fine establishment."

**About Lorroakan:**
"To *truly* know Master Lorroakan is the work of a lifetime. Suffice it to say he is a powerful, important man whose powers exceed the limitations by which *most* wizards are constrained."

**Tax Scam:**
Players can attempt to steal taxes by:
- **Deception (DC 25):** Claim to be "Mister Marvin Hudd" the collections officer
- **Persuasion (DC 20):** Convince it taxes are better in your hands
- **Intimidation (DC 20):** Threaten to crush its head

Success: "Logic detected; petition approved. Enjoy!" or "Threat detected. Commence amelioration protocol."

Failure: "Fallacy detected. Petition denied." or "Threat detected. Commence silent treatment."

**If Lorroakan is Dead:**
The Narrator notes: "*Lorroakan's illusion is blissfully unaware of its caster's demise, but remains bound to its duties.*"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "The great and powerful Lorroakan, offering our humble group an audience? We are honoured." (Dripping with sarcasm)

*No Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*
