The player meets Lucretious, the ringmaster of the circus - a flamboyant necromancer who's trying to train dancing skeletons (Lucille, Jacob, and Boris) in her tent. She introduces herself grandly: "ringmaster, necromancer, Bringer of the Night - oh, and wine-lover extraordinaire."

After the doppelganger clown attack, she becomes enraged that someone impersonated her star performer Dribbles. She asks the player to find the real Dribbles, offering "love, adoration, and adequate compensation" as a reward. When the player mentions Dribbles might be dead, she's unfazed - "Even better! Corpses are wonderful employees. They aren't picky about things like 'working from home' or 'eating'."

If the player finds and returns all of Dribbles' body parts, Lucretious is thrilled despite the rat bites and missing teeth: "I shall remake Dribbles better than before. Where once he was famous, he will now become legend!" She rewards the player and prepares to move the circus out of the city via magic.

If the player asks about the dryad Zethino disappearing (Orin impersonation):
- Lucretious dismisses the concern, saying she's "likely off partying in the Feywild" and will return when she's ready
