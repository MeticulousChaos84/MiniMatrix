The dialogue with the Flaming Fist guard who stands near the main entrance of the Big Barn, which holds donations for the refugee camp. If any of the other Fists catch the player trespassing or stealing, they bring them to this guard for interrogation.

The guard, known as the "Manip" (short for Manipulator, a Flaming Fist rank), is responsible for security around the refugee camp supplies. He can be persuaded, deceived, or bribed depending on the player's approach.

**If caught stealing or trespassing:**
The player is brought before the Manip to explain themselves. Options include:
- Talking their way out
- Paying a fine
- Going peacefully to prison
- Fighting back
