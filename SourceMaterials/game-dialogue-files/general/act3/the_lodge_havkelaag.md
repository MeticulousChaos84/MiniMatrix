Havkelaag is a member of the Society of Brilliance obsessed with proving his theory of "Genetic Morality" - that githyanki are inherently evil but can be "cured" through torturous conditioning. This dialogue only plays if the gith kid massacre hasn't happened.

**Havkelaag's Greetings:**
- To Githyanki: "Ah, a visitor from the astral expanse."
- To Underdark races: "Ah, a fellow inhabitor of the Underdark."
- To surface dwellers: "Ah, a surface dweller."

**About the Society:**
"You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to the Underdark: *the Society of Brilliance*."

**Seeking the Githyanki Egg:**
If player met Lady Esther: "Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her."

"I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course."

**His Theory:**
"The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months."

"Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will."

"I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows."

**The Experiment Details:**
"In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside."

"Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:"

"The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue."

"Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most."

**About the Ptarian Code:**
"A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut."

"In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured."

**Justifying His Methods:**
"The child will be a *better* individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment."

"Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society."

"My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come."

**If Experiment Fails:**
"If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens."

**Player Challenges:**
- "No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty."
- "This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg."
- Monk option: "You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious."
- Druid option: "That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order."

Havkelaag dismisses concerns: "Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects."

**Selling the Egg:**
Players can sell the githyanki egg for gold. Havkelaag is delighted: "Wonderful. I'll begin making preliminary notes at once."

"You've provided me with a fine specimen. I'll be sure to mention your name in the footnotes."

**Refusing to Sell:**
"Then I will source another subject, and the experiment will be completed without your involvement."

"Progress may be delayed, but I assure you - it can never be stopped."

**Lae'zel:** "A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This *shka'keth* should be bled dry for the mere suggestion."
