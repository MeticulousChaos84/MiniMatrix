The player meets with Lord Enver Gortash in his private office after killing Orin and bringing both Netherstones. Gortash is pleased: "I commend you for putting an end to Orin's madness - she must be screaming bloody murder in the Hells even now."

**If the player is Dark Urge:**
Gortash reflects on their partnership, saying he "always preferred your methods to hers" - noting the Dark Urge has mastery over their urges while Orin was consumed by obsessions.

The conversation is interrupted by an earthquake - "the brain awakens." Gortash summons his Banite bodyguards and (if not destroyed) a Steel Watcher for protection.

He demands: "Hand me the Netherstones, and we will rule as one."

**Companion reactions to this demand:**

**Astarion:** "Call me cynical, but I'm not sure we can trust the god of tyranny's Chosen to happily share power."

**Gale:** "Hmm. I can think of more trustworthy accomplices - more than a few, in fact."

Other companions also interject - Karlach says "If there was ever a moment to kill this fucker, this is it."

**If the player hands over the Netherstones:**
Gortash immediately betrays them: "You surrender your advantage too quickly. I did not expect such craven behaviour from one who faced Orin and lived. Such a weak ally is of no use to me."

**If the player refuses to hand them over:**
Gortash is pleased - "I was merely testing you. This should be an alliance of peers." He offers to meet at the Morphic Pool to take control of the Elder Brain together: "First, we take Baldur's Gate, then Faerûn. All of Toril will soon follow. A thousand kingdoms, at our command."

The player can use Insight or Detect Thoughts to read Gortash's intentions - he wants the player to refuse and prove their strength.
