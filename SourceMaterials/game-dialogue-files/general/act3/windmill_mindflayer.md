A mind flayer hiding in the windmill near Rivington asks the player to bring it a corpse to feed upon. The illithid is desperate for sustenance and will bargain with the player for food.

**The Request:**

The mind flayer offers information or rewards in exchange for bringing it a fresh corpse. If there's a non-illithid companion in the party, the mind flayer briefly considers them as "potential food" before the player can redirect the conversation.

**Moral Choices:**

The player can:
- Agree to bring a corpse (raising questions about where to obtain one)
- Refuse to help the creature
- Attack the mind flayer
- Try to negotiate different terms

This encounter highlights the desperation of mind flayers cut off from their colony and the Elder Brain, forced to scrounge for sustenance rather than feeding on prepared victims.
