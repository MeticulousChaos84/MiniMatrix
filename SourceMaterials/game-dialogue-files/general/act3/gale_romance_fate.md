This epilogue scene shows Gale waking up beside his romantic partner after the battle for Baldur's Gate. It's a tender, intimate moment where they discuss their future together.

Gale marvels at how surreal it feels to simply wake up next to someone after all they've been through. For the first time in a long while, he greets the sunrise without fear it will be his last.

If Karlach is the romance partner:

- Gale promises to find a solution for her engine
- He suggests searching his library in Waterdeep for "hellish thermodynamics"
- He remains optimistic despite the circumstances

The dialogue emphasizes the newfound peace and hope that comes after surviving such an ordeal, and hints at the adventures still to come for the couple.
