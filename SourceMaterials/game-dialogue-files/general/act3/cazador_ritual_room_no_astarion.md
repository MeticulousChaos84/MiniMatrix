# Cazador's Ritual Room - Without Astarion

---

This dialogue occurs when the party enters Cazador's ritual room but Astarion is not present in the active party. Cazador's Rite of Profane Ascension is underway or about to begin.

Without Astarion:
- The scene loses its personal stakes
- Cazador may not have his seventh spawn for the ritual
- The party encounters the horror without personal connection

The ritual room is the heart of Cazador's centuries-long scheme - where he planned to sacrifice his seven spawn to become a Vampire Ascendant with power rivaling the gods.
