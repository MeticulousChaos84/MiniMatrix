Mayrina returns in Act 3 as a transformed woman - no longer the helpless victim you rescued from Auntie Ethel, but a determined hag hunter. After being cured from a hag curse (she was turned into a sheep!), she's "utterly FURIOUS" about being manipulated again.

"That lying, thieving, scaly little shit. I can't believe I let a hag hurt my own people. *Again.*"

Mayrina has been hunting hags since Act 1: "After you saved me from Ethel, I was ashamed - of how stupid I was. How *helpless*." She provides the player with hag research materials including the Scroll of Burning Pearls to make the Ethel rematch easier.

**Connor's Fate:**
If Connor (her zombie husband) is still with her, players can ask about his condition:
- "At the beginning, I saw a spark of the old Connor in his eyes. But recently - nothing."

If the player suggests letting Connor die for mercy:
- **Gale:** -1 approval (disapproves of giving up)
- **Astarion:** +1 approval
- Mayrina refuses: "He's not a corpse, he's my *husband*"

If Ethel is still alive and revealed to be in the city, Mayrina realizes killing Ethel might break her curse on Connor: "Wait - Ethel's magic turned him into this monster. If she's still alive, maybe that's why he's stuck like this!"

**Quest Completion:**
When Ethel is finally killed, Mayrina's request: "Tell her Mayrina says hi."

If the player made a deal with Ethel instead of killing her, Mayrina turns hostile: "What have you done?! You BASTARD!"
