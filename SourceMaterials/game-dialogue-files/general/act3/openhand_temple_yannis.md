Sister Yannis is a priestess of Ilmater who has taken on responsibilities at the Open Hand Temple following Father Lorgan's murder. She's convinced that Brilgor, the tiefling refugee accused of killing Lorgan, is innocent.

Yannis explains: "One of the refugees - a tiefling called Brilgor - killed Father Lorgan. Allegedly. Doesn't add up to me... He risked everything for those refugees. Doesn't make sense for one of them to kill him."

**The Murder Investigation:**

The player can investigate the murder and report findings to Yannis:
- **Murder weapon found** - "That's it! Proof that Valeria missed something. They'll have to listen to you now."
- **Target list discovered** - "By His holy tears... That's - that's terrifying."
- **Spoke to corpses** - "Talking to the victims' corpses was clever, but I don't know if Valeria will accept that testimony."
- **Identified Dolor as killer** - "The real killer's name was Dolor? Shame we have no hard proof of that."

If the player already killed Dolor the Bhaalist, they can tell Yannis: "A Bhaalist serial killer in the Lower City claimed he murdered Lorgan - not this refugee." She responds with relief: "Ilmater grants us small mercies on occasion."

**Side Quest - Shirra Clarwen:**
If the player has the Sentient Amulet quest, Yannis reveals Shirra is buried in the temple crypt: "She's buried in the temple crypt. Passed only last year, poor thing."

Yannis directs the player to Investigator Valeria at Sharess' Caress to report findings.
