At the end of the queue leading to the South Span's checkpoint, the player encounters a young tiefling journalist named Lens. She wears a worn overcoat and is taking notes and quotes from the poor souls trying to get into Baldur's Gate.

This is actually Orin the Red in disguise, observing the player to tailor-make their death. Lens represents herself as "someone who has to tell the true story" of what's happening outside the city walls.

The conversation allows Orin to test the player's temperament and reactions while appearing as an unassuming news worker taking the beat of the outside city.
