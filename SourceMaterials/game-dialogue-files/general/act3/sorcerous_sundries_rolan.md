**Starting Node:** 38

---

Rolan serves as Lorroakan's apprentice and runs the shop floor at Sorcerous Sundries. His treatment varies dramatically based on whether Cal and Lia survived.

**If Cal and Lia Survived:**
"You. What are you doing here?" (Delighted to see the player)

"This is my 'apprenticeship'. It has not been what I expected. Master Lorroakan is... a difficult man."

**His Frustration:**
"He's consumed by his pursuit of the Nightsong. I haven't learnt a thing and I fear it'll stay that way."

About Aradin: "Master Lorroakan has a contract out to any idiot with legs to find the Nightsong. Aradin is one such idiot."

**If Siblings Died:**
Rolan is hostile: "You. What do you want?" or "You. Get out. Now."

If the player let his siblings die in Moonrise Towers: "After you left Cal and Lia to die, I never want to see your face again."

**Rolan's Bruises:**
Observant players notice Rolan's beaten face. Various class options can ask about it:
- Barbarian/Fighter/Rogue: "I know a beating when I see one."
- Drow: "I know the marks of subjugation."

Rolan deflects: "Nothing for you to worry about." A successful Insight check reveals "Something's wrong here."

**About the Nightsong Contract:**
"If you've got information, Master Lorroakan will want to speak to you immediately. He speaks of almost nothing else than the Nightsong's retrieval."

"Be *very* sure before you make to visit Lorroakan. He's got a beastly temper."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I've heard rumours about Lorroakan's 'teaching'. Or lack of it. His students are no more than glorified shopkeeps."

**Gale:** "A lucky escape, given Lorroakan's reputation. He'd have little of value to teach you."

*No Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*
