Tolna runs the Literature Department at Sorcerous Sundries and speaks exclusively in whispers. She guards information about the shop's rare and dangerous books locked in the vault.

**Tolna's Introduction:**
"(Literature Department. Can I help you?)"

**About Rare Books:**
"(Bold! You might've heard that our library has a collection other shops would lack the skill to curate.)"

"(Between us, even Master Lorroakan was reluctant to house them in his tower. The pen is mightier than the magic wand, apparently.)"

**The Rare Collection:**
Tolna describes four dangerous tomes locked in the vault:
- **The Tharchiate Codex** - Key to reading the final chapter of "The Necromancy of Thay"
- **The Annals of Karsus: A Netherese Folly** - Written by Lord Karsus himself, contains great magical knowledge
- **Sights of the Seelie** - Author made contact with the Seelie Court
- **The Curriculum of Strategy** - Compiled by the Red Knight, exarch of Tempus

**About the Annals of Karsus:**
"(It is said to be written by Lord Karsus himself, the Netherese arcanist who attempted to replace the goddess Mystra, failed, and was banished for the attempt.)"

"(Great magical knowledge lies within those pages, but not many can withstand it.)"

**The Vault:**
Tolna refuses to sell the rare books: "(Buy? Books as temperamental as these are not on sale. They are secured in our vault, where none can harm them, nor can they do any harm.)"

Players can attempt to learn vault access through:
- **Deception (DC 18):** "I came here all the way from Neverwinter to admire your collection. Couldn't I just peek in the vault?"
- **Intimidation (DC 16):** "Unless you want a very nasty paper cut, you're going to tell me how to get into that vault."
- **Persuasion (DC 18):** "Isn't it your job to share knowledge, not keep it locked away?" (DC 16 for Wizards)

Success: "(The only way to gain access to the vault is through my office. And before you ask - no, you are not allowed in there either.)"

**Shouting at Books:**
Players can yell "IS THAT TRUE, BOOKS? ARE YOU SENSITIVE?" which causes magical books to explode and angers Tolna.

**About Rolan Taking Over:**
"(Who now? Oh. Rolan. I leave him alone. He leaves me alone. That's all there is to it, I'm happy to say.)"

**About Nightsong Being Caged:**
"(I'd prefer not to discuss that beastly business.)"

"(Sorcerous Sundries is an institution of this city, one I am proud to serve, even if it passes through some rather loathsome hands from time to time.)"
