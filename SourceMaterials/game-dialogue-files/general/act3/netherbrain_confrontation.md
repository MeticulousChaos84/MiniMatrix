The party finally confronts the Netherbrain directly in the Morphic Pool. This is the moment of truth where they must use the Netherstones to cast Karsus's Compulsion and attempt to dominate the brain.

The scene includes:
- The party's first direct psychic contact with the Netherbrain
- Reactions to companions who might succumb to its influence
- The desperate attempt to wrest control from the Absolute

The dialogue captures the horror and urgency of facing an elder brain enhanced by the Crown of Karsus and three Netherstones.
