The Devil's Fee is a shop specializing in diabolical artifacts and infernal goods, run by Helsik - a mortal who has made extensive deals with devils. She's one of the few people who can help the party access the House of Hope, Raphael's personal domain in Avernus.

Helsik offers:
- Information about Raphael and the House of Hope
- The ritual to open a portal to Avernus
- Various infernal items and artifacts
- Knowledge about devil deals and contracts

Both Gale and Astarion see the opportunity to turn the tables on Raphael - to visit HIM for a change instead of the other way around.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I think it's about time we imposed ourselves on Raphael's hospitality for a change."

**Astarion:** "Then perhaps we should drop by and surprise Raphael? It'd make a nice change."
