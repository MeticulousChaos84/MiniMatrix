Lady Jannath, now Oskar's wife, greets the player at Jannath Estate amid supernatural chaos. She recognizes the player from Oskar's sketches as "the one who saved him from the Zhentarim."

"You should have seen him on our wedding day. So vibrant. So *alive*. He couldn't have been happier."

But after the wedding, Oskar deteriorated rapidly: "Not long after the wedding, he lost his appetite, fell into dark moods. He started to avoid my company entirely. Artistic temperament, I thought. But it worsened. He became violent. Called me some rather imaginative names."

The house itself has become haunted: "The last time I left this room, the walls started bleeding, and a portrait of my mother tried to bite me."

Jannath concludes: "Something *unnatural* has taken hold of him. Oskar has been *possessed*."

**About Connor (Act 1 Reference):**
If the player bought Oskar's freedom without negotiating, they can demand repayment. Jannath responds archly: "How mercenary of you."

If players suggest Oskar isn't worth saving, Jannath defends him: "He's my husband. He's worth everything."

**Class-Specific Options:**
- **Clerics** recognize: "Possessions cannot be fixed with a simple 'cure'. He needs an expert in the supernatural."
- **Warlocks** note: "While I've been... aided by powerful forces, that doesn't mean I can help Oskar."

Jannath directs players to investigate his atelier for clues about what spirit has taken hold.
