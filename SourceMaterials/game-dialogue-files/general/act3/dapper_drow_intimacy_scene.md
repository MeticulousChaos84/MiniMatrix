This is the intimate scene with the dapper drow twins Nym and Sorn Orlith at Sharess' Caress. The scene can include the player, both drow siblings, a romanced companion, and optionally Halsin. Nym casts darkness to begin, noting "I must snuff out the lights before we begin."

The scene has different variations depending on which companion participates:

**If Astarion is the romance partner:**
He takes control confidently, demonstrating his "flawless technique." The drow comment on his beautiful, pearl-like translucent skin. If he became Vampire Lord, he comments about "dining upon this four-course meal." The narration reveals that despite his perfect performance, "when you meet his eye for a moment, there's a look about him that reveals he's a million realms away."

**If Gale participates:**
He sends a magical illusory duplicate of himself instead of appearing in person. The duplicate awkwardly announces: "Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gale of Waterdeep to participate in this evening's activities. He would like me to assure you all that I am anatomically accurate." When Halsin teases him, the illusion tuts disapprovingly but "the orb in his naked chest glows with telltale excitement."

**If Shadowheart participates:**
The drow siblings fall to their knees in mock-prayer, worshipping her as an "empyrean high priestess." She admits she "had a dream just like this once" and that Halsin was in it, making it "lively."

**If Halsin participates:**
He can transform into a bear form, terrifying and delighting the drow. Halsin and Astarion have flirtatious exchanges about "kisses with teeth" and "caresses by claws."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "All right sweethearts. You dare to dance with a professional, you'll get your desire."

**Astarion:** "I wish... to drink. And to be drunk."

**Astarion:** "Me too."

**Astarion:** "My fair consort, I can't wait to dine upon this four-course meal with you."

**Astarion:** "Just a figure of speech. I promise not to bite down to the bone."

**Astarion:** "You haven't earned the right to stare at me like that."

**Astarion:** "I can't help myself - you look so delicious."

**Astarion:** "None as beautiful as me."

**Astarion:** "I hope you like a kiss with teeth, druid."

**Gale:** "Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gale of Waterdeep to participate in this evening's activities. He would like me to assure you all that I am anatomically accurate."

**Gale:** "I am involved! I'm taking notes. Making observations."

**Gale:** "My word."

**Gale:** "I'll enjoy myself well enough from back here! You go on and do... the rutting or what have you."
