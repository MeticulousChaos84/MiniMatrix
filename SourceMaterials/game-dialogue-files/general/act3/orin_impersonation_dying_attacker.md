In the Smuggler's Cave in Wyrm's Crossing, the player finds a man impaled on driftwood by a sword through his belly. This is actually Orin the Red in disguise, testing the player's capacity for violence or mercy.

The "dying man" begs: "Come to finish the job? ... Argh. By the gods... it hurts. Help me, please. ... Get this blade out of me... Use it... Kill me... kill me NOW."

**Perception Check (DC 20):**
Success reveals: "There's something strange about the man dying before your eyes. Though in agony, he seems to be enjoying this."

**Resolution Options:**

**Merciful options:**
- Try to heal him (Good Cleric variant available)
- "I'll stay with you until the end, but I won't speed your passage." (+1 Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Jaheira +2, Minsc +2, Halsin +1)

**Violent options:**
- "Prod the man's wound. See just how much pain he's in." / "Spin the blade: twist and toy with it." (+1 Astarion, +1 Minthara, -1 Halsin, Karlach, Jaheira, Minsc)
- "What's the hurry? I'll enjoy watching you die slowly." (Dark Urge only) - Same approvals

**When Orin Reveals Herself:**

To the Dark Urge: "Look at it, come crawling home, hands stained with the Bone Lord's soot. And you carry his stone... Even with your head meat tumbled, you tickle and torture so brutishly. A blunt and tasteless slaughter."

If merciful: "Is this the blood-starved mercy you come to offer me, sibling? I have none to offer you."

To non-Dark Urge: "So you're the lickspittle who crushed the Bone Lord's thrall. Have you come beg-begging, sniffing for our stones? Gortash won't like that."

She warns about Gortash: "He will sniff out your mercies, drag them forth and use them to dress his atrocities."
