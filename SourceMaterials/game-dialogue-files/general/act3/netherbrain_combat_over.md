# Netherbrain Combat Over - Victory Aftermath

**Source:** `END_BrainBattle_CombatOver.html`
**Starting Node:** 78

After the destruction of the Netherbrain, the survivors swim to shore and take stock of their victory over the burning city. This is the immediate aftermath where companions react to what just happened.

Key events:
- The githyanki depart on red dragons - Lae'zel can choose to join them or stay
- Orpheus's fate is addressed - he may have become a mind flayer and must decide whether to live or die
- Karlach's engine crisis comes to a head
- The party discusses what to do next

If Orpheus became a mind flayer:
- Lae'zel may kill him as an "abomination"
- Companions react to her decision
- Orpheus may request death himself

The dialogue branches extensively based on who became the mind flayer (player, Orpheus, or Karlach) and the relationships between party members.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "He sacrificed his soul to save your people, Lae'zel. Surrendered his very being to prevent the Grand Design. I'd say it's a tad ungrateful to murder him for it."

**Gale:** "Go forth, Lae'zel, to distant realms. I will miss you dearly."

**Gale:** "If it wasn't for you, we'd be thralls, dead, or who knows. This is your victory."

**Gale:** "You won't hear a syllable of disagreement from these lips. Thank you."

**Gale:** "Oh, spare me the modesty. They should erect statues to you... though they may frighten children."

**Astarion:** "Yes, put the poor beast out of its misery." *(if he became Vampire Lord)*

**Astarion:** "He gave up everything to save us, Lae'zel. Is this really the best you can offer him?" *(if he stayed spawn)*

**Astarion:** "Lae'zel, darling - there never was one so delicious as you. Until we meet again."

**Astarion:** "I'm glad your prince is taking his fate so well. I'd be devastated if I was that ugly."

**Astarion:** "Although credit where it's due - you were a worthy ally up there. If not for you, that brain may have bested us."

**Astarion:** "Although - well, better you than me."
