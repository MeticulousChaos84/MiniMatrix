This dialogue occurs at the main entrance to the Temple of Bhaal, hidden deep beneath Baldur's Gate. The temple is the seat of power for the Cult of Bhaal and where Orin, the Slayer and Chosen of Bhaal, holds court.

Accessing the temple requires:
- Finding the secret entrance
- Potentially having Bhaal's mark or Orin's invitation
- Dealing with guards or traps

The atmosphere is oppressive and dripping with the Lord of Murder's influence - blood, bones, and the whispers of death surround the entrance.
