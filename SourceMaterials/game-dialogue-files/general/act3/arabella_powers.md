Arabella, the tiefling child first encountered in the Emerald Grove, reappears in Act 3 with mysterious new powers. If her parents died in Act 1 or 2, she has been surviving on her own and has developed strange abilities.

The party encounters Arabella and discovers that her connection to Silvanus (the nature god whose idol she stole) has manifested in unexpected ways. The dialogue explores:
- What happened to Arabella after leaving the grove
- The nature of her new powers
- Her grief over losing her parents
- Whether she can control her abilities

Both Gale and Astarion recognize her immediately upon seeing her.
