Ferg is a Sharran lookout at the refugee camp who has been instructed to watch for Shadowheart. He also works as a fence and money launderer for the Sharran cult.

**If Shadowheart is in the party:**
Ferg becomes nervous when he recognizes her. His reaction depends on whether Shadowheart has embraced or rejected Shar's teachings.

**Trading with Ferg:**
The player can convince him to offer his unique and unusual wares for trade. As a fence for the cult, he has access to items that may be difficult to find elsewhere - though the player may need to persuade him to trust them first.

This encounter is particularly significant for Shadowheart's storyline, as it reveals the extent of the Sharran network's surveillance even in the refugee camps outside Baldur's Gate.
