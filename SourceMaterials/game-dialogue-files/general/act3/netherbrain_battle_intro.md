# Netherbrain Battle Introduction

**Source:** `END_BrainBattle_Intro.html`
**Starting Node:** 27

This dialogue plays as the party enters the final combat arena after climbing the Netherbrain's stem. The Crown of Karsus is visible - that's where they need to cast the domination spell.

If the Emperor sided with the brain, it appears enthralled and raises an army. If the Emperor is with the party, the brain raises super-thralls trained on their exact weaknesses.

Gale faces a crucial moment here if he was swayed toward claiming the Crown - he sees an opportunity for godhood. But the player can try to convince him to sacrifice himself with the orb instead.

Key decision points:
- Gale can agree to use the orb to end everything
- Gale can insist on pursuing the Crown
- The player can stay by Gale's side or be teleported to safety
- Gale may teleport himself alone to sacrifice himself

If Gale agrees to sacrifice himself:
- He asks the player to carry his memory
- Romance partners have especially poignant farewells

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Can't you feel it? We're almost there."

**Gale:** "Once we ascend the Netherbrain's stem, we'll be in touching distance of the crown. Of reclaiming the powers of Karsus himself."

**Gale:** "I'm ready. Are you?"

**Gale:** "And I would die in the process, just to win the favour of a goddess who scarcely cares for me."

**Gale:** "Sometimes I wish I were a more selfish man. Life would be so much easier. But alas..."

**Gale:** "You're right. The orb is the only way. All that's left for me to do is spirit you away to safety. Are you ready?"

**Gale:** "Please... this will be so much easier knowing that my memory lives on with you."

**Gale:** "No. Let me do this on my terms. Besides - I need someone left to sing my praises, after I'm gone."

**Gale:** "I can end this now - stop the Absolute, and spare the city. The stage is set for my final act. Mystra's bidding. And the redemption that lies beyond."

**Gale:** "The brain... it's high above the city now - far away from any innocents."

**Astarion:** "Gale? You have a look. I'm not sure I care for it."

**Astarion:** "Well I care for that even less. Let's make sure we prevail, then."

**Astarion:** "I... I don't know what to say. Thank you."

**Astarion:** "That's it! We have to use the Netherstones on the Crown - it's the only hope we have."

**Astarion:** "Well that's just disgusting."
