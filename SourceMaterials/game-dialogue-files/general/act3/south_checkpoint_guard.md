# South Span Checkpoint Guard

The primary guard at the Wyrm's Crossing South checkpoint dialogue. A Steel Watcher checks if the player has been in conflict with a scrying eye, and attacks if warranted.

This checkpoint controls access from Rivington into Wyrm's Rock Fortress and the Lower City beyond. The Steel Watchers here are part of Gortash's security apparatus, tracking anyone who has damaged or interfered with the city's surveillance network.

**Checkpoint Outcomes:**

If the player has destroyed scrying eyes, the Watchers become hostile and attempt to arrest them. Otherwise, the player may pass through with:
- Valid documentation
- Persuasion
- Bribery (risky - the Watchers report this)

The Steel Watchers are particularly vigilant during this time due to the coronation at Wyrm's Rock Fortress and increased security measures.
