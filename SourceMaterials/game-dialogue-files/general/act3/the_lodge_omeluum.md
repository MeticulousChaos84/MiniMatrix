Omeluum is a friendly mind flayer who returns to the Society of Brilliance Lodge after being rescued from the Iron Throne prison. This dialogue explores the aftermath of the rescue and Omeluum's gratitude.

**If Player Killed Society Members:**
Omeluum is angered: "*Such violence has no place here. The Society is an institution that aims to bring about peace. Not destruction.*"

If Blurg was killed: "*Blurg... my loyal friend. I will not find the likes of his mind and curiosity again.*"

**Standard Greeting (Rescued All Prisoners):**
"*It is... pleasurable to see you. Your intervention within the cult's underwater complex was a timely one.*"

"*I am glad my carelessness did not cost the lives of the innocent captives.*"

"*That you also saved me was unexpected.*"

**If Duke Ravengard Survived:**
"*I am glad my carelessness did not cost the life of Duke Ravengard.*"

**If Most Prisoners Died:**
"*My colleagues here are grateful you came to my rescue. Though I regret that my investigations ended in such failure.*"

"*I did not expect that mine would be the life you chose to save.*"

**Why He Was Imprisoned:**
"*My meeting with you led me to a most unsettling conclusion. That my kind had begun to exert influence through this 'Cult of the Absolute.'*"

"*I felt illithid interference would not be conducive to this plane's survival. I sought out other infected individuals to ascertain the truth of my hypothesis.*"

"*Unfortunately, I strayed too close. I was captured and transported to the prison in which you found me.*"

"*There I saw Gortash and his followers inflict cruelties far beyond any I witnessed in the Underdark.*"

**Player Responses:**
- "You tried to save me once. Only fair that I repay the favour." - Omeluum: "*Then you would keep our equation balanced. A logical approach.*"
- "I would never have left you behind. I rather like you." - Omeluum: "*I too feel some... warmth at your presence.*" (To Githyanki: "*Such kinship is unnatural for two such as we are. Yet I too feel some... warmth at your presence.*")
- "Gratitude won't keep a roof over my head..." - Omeluum: "*I understand my gratitude has limited use. You desire more practical compensation for your troubles.*"
- "Hard for you to reward me from the bottom of the ocean." - Omeluum: "*A valid hypothesis. One I am glad we do not need to prove.*"

**About the Ring (If Player Used It):**
"*The ring I gave possessed no real capacity to control the tadpole's influence. I simply wished to give you hope.*"

"*Because hope is important to your kind. Given enough of it, I believed you would not give up on finding the explanation for your tadpole's stasis.*"

Player reactions:
- "So I've been wearing that ring for nothing?" - Omeluum: "*You wore it because you believed it helped. Therefore it was helping you. Your belief was the ring's purpose, and it served it well.*"
- Monk option: "That's legitimate - my master used similar conceptual tools to focus my mind during training."
- Dragonborn option: "You tricked me. I cannot abide trickery."

**The Reward:**
"*Blurg and I have consulted on the matter of your reward.*"

"*We first thought to ask the denizens of the Underdark for their aid in fighting the cult. Alas, our influence there remains negligible.*"

"*Instead, we have selected a series of items from the Society's vaults.*"

"*Given my kind's involvement in creating this evil, it is only right that I do my part in helping you defeat it. Or at least, improving your odds.*"

**Cold Player Options:**
- "Ravengard meant nothing to me." (if he died) - Approval: Wyll -5, Karlach -1, Jaheira -1 / Astarion +1, Minthara +1
- "The hostages meant nothing to me." - Approval: Minthara +1, Astarion +1, Lae'zel +1 / Gale -1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Jaheira -1, Minsc -1, Halsin -1
- "I killed your colleagues. I just came to finish the job." - Approval: Lae'zel +1, Minthara +1, Astarion +1 / Wyll -1, Karlach -1, Gale -1, Shadowheart -1 (Omeluum attacks)

**If Ravengard Died:**
"*Still, I feel a heaviness within me. Ravengard's death will destabilise Baldur's Gate. It may adapt, or it may perish. But it will undoubtedly be transformed.*"

**Omeluum's Plans:**
"*Once my report is completed, I will return to my usual work in the Underdark. There, at least, I may yet produce worthwhile results.*"
