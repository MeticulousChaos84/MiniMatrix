The player witnesses Lord Enver Gortash's coronation as Grand Duke at Wyrm's Rock Fortress. Duke Ulder Ravengard (under Absolute control) delivers the ceremonial speech: "From earth do we rise. In fire are we forged. In steel are we mighty!"

If Wyll is present, he immediately recognizes his father and whispers "Father..." or "My father. He's here."

The player may be confronted by Steel Watchers upon arrival, who threaten: "Stand down, villain. In the name of the Steel Watch. Aggressive action will not be tolerated."

When Gortash notices the player, he addresses them warmly - especially if they have a reputation:
- If Wyll is present: "The Blade of Frontiers graces our halls"
- If Wyll is in devil form: "He's wearing his devilish best"
- If Karlach is present, he greets her as an "old friend"

**If the player is a Dark Urge:**
Gortash reveals their shared history, calling them his "favourite assassin" and explaining they were partners in creating the Absolute plot. He reveals how Orin betrayed the Dark Urge and took their place. "You and I initiated this plot. We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them."

Gortash explains the three-part plan of the Dead Three:
1. Orin the Red creates panic through murders in the Absolute's name
2. Ketheric Thorm's undead armies form the military threat
3. Gortash, as Bane's champion, offers "law, order, and protection" as the savior

He proposes an alliance: "Together we can still restore authority over the brain" using the three Netherstones. He warns that without control, the Elder Brain will free itself and begin the Grand Design - the mind flayer empire reborn.

Key approvals when Gortash greets the party: +1 to all companions, +3 to Wyll and Karlach
