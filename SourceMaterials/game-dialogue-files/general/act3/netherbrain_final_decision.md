# Netherbrain Final Decision

**Source:** `END_BrainBattle_FinalDecision.html`
**Starting Node:** 55

After using Karsus' Compulsion on the Netherbrain, the player faces the ultimate choice. The dialogue begins in the Mental Arena and ends in the sky above Baldur's Gate.

The brain is subdued, on the cusp of its final thought. Karlach (or whoever became the mind flayer) struggles to keep it there. The player must decide:

**Destroy the Brain:**
- Command it to destroy all tadpoles and then itself
- This is the "good" ending
- Dark Urge players who accepted Bhaal must defy their father

**Control the Brain:**
- Become the Absolute
- Rule the world through the Netherbrain
- Romance partners may encourage this (evil paths)

If the player is a Dark Urge who accepted Bhaal:
- The narrator reminds them of their "life-long destiny promised by your Father. Enslave. Dominate. Ruin."
- Bhaal threatens to "flay and shred your mind" if they don't seize the brain

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "What are you doing...?"

**Gale:** "Command it to die. Quickly!"

**Gale:** "Ignore it. Nothing but a vile death rattle."

**Astarion:** "It can be ours, my love. The whole world - we only have to take it." *(if romanced, not spawn)*

**Astarion:** "I know what you're thinking. So let's do it. Let's seize the whole damn world and be reviled together." *(Dark Urge path)*

**Astarion:** "We could do it, you know. We could rule the world."

**Astarion:** "What in all the sweet hells are you doing?!"

**Astarion:** "All right, it's time. Let's end this."

**Astarion:** "Shut it out. It's on the precipice - push it over."
