The player walks into the barracks room at Wyrm's Rock Fortress and disturbs a Flaming Fist who appears to be breaking into a locked chest. The conversation should be kept quiet - he doesn't want to wake the others sleeping in the barracks.

**The Situation:**

The guard is planning to desert his post and flee the city. He's gathering his valuables before making his escape, nervous about the Steel Watchers and what's happening in Baldur's Gate.

**Player Options:**

During conversation, the player can:
- **Challenge him** - Confront him about desertion and theft
- **Discover his stash location** - Learn where he's hidden valuables
- **Persuade him to stay** - Convince him not to flee and to protect the city instead
- **Let him go** - Allow him to desert without interference
- **Blackmail him** - Demand payment for silence

The guard represents the growing fear and disillusionment among Gortash's own forces, as soldiers recognize the dangerous direction the city is heading.
