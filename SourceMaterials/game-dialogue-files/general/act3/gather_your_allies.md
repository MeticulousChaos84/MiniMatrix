Before the final assault on the Netherbrain, the party gathers all the allies they've recruited throughout their journey. This is the moment where every faction, every friend, every saved soul can potentially show up to aid in the battle.

The scene features various allies offering their support:
- Harpers
- Druids
- Tieflings
- Goblins (if recruited)
- Various NPCs from sidequests

If Astarion became a Vampire Lord and brings his spawn:
- He commands them as his "dark forces"
- The spawn follow his orders absolutely

This is a moment of hope and unity before the darkness - a reminder that the player's choices throughout the game have built an army of the grateful and the willing.

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "My dark forces are at your command today. We have a common goal."

*No Gale spoken lines appear in this conversation.*
