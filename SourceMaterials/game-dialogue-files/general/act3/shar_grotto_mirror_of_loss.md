The Mirror of Loss is a Sharran relic in the Darkmoon Cloister. Players can offer memories in exchange for a chance to receive stat-improving memories from others.

**Shadowheart's Recognition:**
If Shadowheart is present: "This feels familiar to me, somehow. I'm sure I've stood before this mirror before... many times, perhaps." (The mirror was used to take her memories from her.)

**Understanding the Mirror:**
With successful Religion or Arcana checks (DC 20-25), players learn: "A Mirror of Loss - a relic said to be as old as the Church of Shar itself. Those who stood before it could surrender their very thoughts and memories to the Lady of Loss."

**Offering Memories:**
Players can surrender memories tied to different stats:
- **Strength** - "Times when you triumphed, thanks to your raw power"
- **Dexterity** - "Your youth, when your heart was carefree and your limbs were nimble"
- **Constitution** - "Fortitude and well-being, when body and mind held fast"
- **Intelligence** - "Valued knowledge gleaned from books, scrolls, tablets"
- **Wisdom** - "Wisdoms that time has bestowed upon you"
- **Charisma** - "When your charm stood to you - the applause of the swayed"

Shadowheart can offer specific memories from her past (graffiti, hideaway, romance, teacher Allister Marnley).

**Receiving Rewards:**
Based on your roll and heart form (determined by the Mapping of the Heart), you may receive:
- Memories from a general (Strength)
- A seasoned thief's exploits (Dexterity)
- A barbarian's endurance (Constitution)
- A Candlekeep wizard's secrets (Intelligence)
- A drow's wisdom (Wisdom)
- A bard's guile (Charisma)

**Fabrication:**
Players can attempt a DC 20 Deception check to trick the mirror with false memories. Success: the mirror accepts false thoughts. Failure: the mirror takes something real with nothing given in return.
