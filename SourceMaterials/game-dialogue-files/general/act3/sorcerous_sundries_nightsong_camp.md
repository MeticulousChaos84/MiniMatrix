The player speaks to Nightsong at camp after learning that Lorroakan is searching for her. This conversation triggers Nightsong leaving camp to confront Lorroakan.

**Nightsong's Opening:**
"Mother's Milk - your visage speaks of ill tidings. Speak, ally mine: what troubles you?"

**Revealing Lorroakan's Plans:**
If the player knows Lorroakan wants to cage her like Ketheric did:

Isobel: "The beast!"

Nightsong: "Oh, I hope he tries. Please, Lorroakan, come to me with your magicks and your flaccid charms. Attempt to lay one hairy finger upon Dame Aylin, daughter of Selûne most high."

"I will wring his neck until he's dead."

**Deceiving Nightsong:**
Players can attempt to trick Nightsong into thinking Lorroakan "just wants to talk" (Deception DC 15). Success: Nightsong agrees to go peacefully.

Isobel objects: "Aylin, I'm not sure about this. Something doesn't feel right."

Nightsong: "Your intuitions are my lodestar, darling. But consider: now that Dame Aylin has returned to the fold of time, she could use allies and interlocutors."

**Isobel's Concern:**
Isobel wants to accompany Nightsong, but Aylin insists she scout for a Selûnite enclave instead: "My darling, we agreed you'd scout for the nearest Selûnite enclave this very night. Let us divide our efforts, all the sooner to be reunited."

**If Player Already Killed Lorroakan:**
Nightsong is delighted: "Ha! Ally mine, you continue to delight. I will pray anew to my Moon Mother for your health, wealth, and happiness."
