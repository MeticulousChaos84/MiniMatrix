Blaze Elin is the first guard at the checkpoint on the south bridge leading to Wyrm's Rock Fortress. She greets visitors with: "No entry today. Special occasion."

**Getting Past the Checkpoint:**

The player can gain access through several methods:

1. **Bribe the guard** - Pay for entry (risky, as it may be reported)

2. **Show Coronation Access Pass** - If the player has obtained one, Blaze allows them through immediately

3. **Show Urgent Report for Duke Ravengard** - Present official documentation to gain entry

The checkpoint is heavily guarded due to Gortash's coronation ceremony taking place at the fortress. Security has been increased with both Flaming Fist soldiers and Steel Watchers patrolling the area.

If the player doesn't have proper documentation or coin, they'll need to find another way around - either through deception, sneaking, or finding alternative routes.
