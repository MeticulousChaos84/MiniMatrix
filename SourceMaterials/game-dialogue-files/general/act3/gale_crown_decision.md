After the githyanki have departed, Gale stands apart looking toward the Chionthar River. He reveals that the Crown of Karsus is somewhere in the water and faces a crucial decision about what to do with it.

Three major paths present themselves:

**Path 1 - Give the Crown to Mystra:**
Gale can choose to return the Crown to Mystra, hoping she'll finally cure him of the orb affliction. This is the "redemption" path.

**Path 2 - Become a God:**
Gale can keep the Crown for himself, using the Karsite Weave to ascend to godhood. He believes he could "raise a new Netheril right here in Faerûn."

**Path 3 - Leave it in the River:**
Gale can decide the Crown is too dangerous and should be left to rust in its watery grave.

If the player encourages Gale toward godhood and is romancing him:
- Gale may leave the party to pursue ascension
- He promises to make the player his Chosen if they ever change their mind

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "The Crown - it's somewhere in the Chionthar."

**Gale:** "I would be more than the greatest wizard who ever lived - I would be a god."

**Gale:** "Mystra has dictated the terms of my potential for long enough. The Crown would grant me control of my own destiny at last."

**Gale:** "Think of all I could achieve, all that I could grant to those whose ambitions are restrained by Mystra's yoke. I could raise a new Netheril right here in Faerûn."

**Gale:** "If this adventure has taught me anything, it's that there are things in this world far more valuable than power."

**Gale:** "Besides, I've grown quite fond of this merry band of ours, and I'd quite like to see what happens to it."

**Gale:** "Ugh, no. Having seen what we've seen of those who chase godhood, I'm quite content with my mortality."

**Gale:** "I fell to hubris once before and landed myself with this orb. I think I'd rather not make the same mistake again."

**Astarion:** "Such ambition - you make me look positively humble."

**Astarion:** "Now, Gale, you're looking decidedly 'thinky'. I hope you're not about to spoil this excellent, excellent plan."

**Astarion:** "I do wonder how he'll fare when Mystra decides to crush him. It could be quite the show."

**Astarion:** "I'll see your 'reckless abandon' and raise you 'unrestrained hedonism'."

**Astarion:** "Gale, are you brooding? Because I swear, if you ruin my good mood..."
