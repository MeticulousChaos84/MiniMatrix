Dialog that occurs when you save Devella from Dolor at Figaro's shop. Devella is a Flaming Fist investigator who has been tracking the Bhaal murder cult.

After being rescued from paralysis, Devella can provide information about the ongoing investigation into the serial killings in Baldur's Gate.

**Player Options:**
- Help Devella continue her investigation
- Ask about the murder cult
- Claim to be there to sacrifice her (which earns Astarion's approval but most companions' disapproval)

**Companion Interjections:**

*No Gale or Astarion spoken lines appear in this conversation.*

(Astarion gains +1 approval if you threaten to sacrifice Devella)
