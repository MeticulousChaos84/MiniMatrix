The player encounters a tense standoff at Arfur Gregorio's house in Rivington. Refugee Ben Golewits stands in the doorway protecting his family, while merchant Arfur Gregorio outside argues with Zenovia Dawg of the Rivington Rats about hiring them to evict the squatters.

Zenovia notes: "Arfur, sweetheart - you paid me and my boys to be caravan guards, not cattle wranglers. If you want us to get our hands dirty, it'd be extra."

**Key Character Insights:**

A passive Insight check (DC 18) reveals: "This man's indignant demeanour barely masks a seething anxiety. There's more to this situation than he's letting on." (Hinting at Arfur's secret explosive teddy bear plot.)

**Resolution Options:**
- **Intimidate Arfur** (DC 20-25) to let the refugees stay
- **Offer to evict refugees** for payment or for free
- **Persuade for half-price** (DC 10) to do the job cheaper than Zenovia
- **Ask about the big house** - prompts Karlach interjection: "Ye gods, this guy is begging to get smacked."
- **Trigger hostility** - Arfur pays Zenovia to attack the player

If the player previously stole Arfur's gold and then provokes him, Zenovia's crew abandons him: "We did our job, Arfur. Looks like your eyes were bigger than your purse."

**Notable Approvals:**
- Choosing to brutalize the poor: Gale -1, Astarion +1, Karlach -1, Wyll -1
- Halsin +1 for druid intimidation about reclaiming land for nature
