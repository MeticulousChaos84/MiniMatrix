## Overview

 

Running along the Sea of Swords from north of Amn to the Sea of Moving Ice, the Sword Coast is a narrow band of territory dominated by the city-states of the area that use the sea for trade.

 

> "For most who care about such things, the area is delimited by Neverwinter in the north and Baldur's Gate in the south, but territory farther to the north and south that isn't under the sway of a more influential power is usually also included in maps of the Sword Coast." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

## Geographic Extent

 

### The Sword Coast Proper

 

- **Northern Boundary:** Neverwinter

- **Southern Boundary:** Baldur's Gate (near the borders of Amn)

- **Western Boundary:** Sea of Swords

- **Eastern Boundary:** Varies by region (High Forest, Anauroch desert)

 

### The North (Broader Region)

 

More broadly, "the North" refers to all the territory north of Amn, split into two general regions:

- The Western Heartlands

- The Savage Frontier

 

## Major Settlements

 

### Lords' Alliance Cities

 

The current members of the Lords' Alliance represent the major civilized settlements of the Sword Coast:

 

- **Amphail** - Small town, noble playground

- **Baldur's Gate** - Southern anchor, major trade hub

- **Daggerford** - Gateway town on the Trade Way

- **Longsaddle** - Hamlet ruled by the Harpell wizard family

- **Mirabar** - Mining city (human above, dwarf below)

- **Mithral Hall** - Dwarven citadel

- **Neverwinter** - Northern anchor, City of Skilled Hands

- **Silverymoon** - Gem of the North, center of learning

- **Waterdeep** - City of Splendors, Crown of the North

- **Yartar** - River trade center

 

### Other Significant Locations

 

- **Luskan** - Northern port city (not Alliance member)

- **Sundabar** - Dwarven city (withdrew from Alliance)

- **Elturgard** - Theocratic realm

- **Candlekeep** - Great library fortress

 

## Historical Development

 

### Elven Foundations

 

Before human settlement, the region was home to several elven kingdoms:

 

- **Illefarn** - Along the Sword Coast from the Spine of the World to the River Delimbiyr, with capital Aelinthaldaar in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep

- **Eaerlann** - Founded by wood elves and moon elves in the Delimbiyr Valley and High Forest

- **Miyeritar** - Founded by separatists in what is now the High Moor

 

### Rise of Human Civilization

 

The great human city-states rose to prominence along the Sword Coast, forming a chain along the Trade Way from Illusk (later Luskan) in the far north to Baldur's Gate in the south.

 

Like their elven and dwarven predecessors, they fought off attacks by savage humanoids, including orc hordes from the Spine of the World.

 

### Dwarven Legacy

 

The North is the homeland of the dwarves of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom. Citadels from that ancient realm still stand:

- Citadel Adbar

- Citadel Felbarr

- Mithral Hall

- Gauntlgrym

 

## Trade Routes

 

### The Trade Way

 

The primary overland trade route connecting the cities of the Sword Coast, running from Baldur's Gate in the south through Daggerford to Waterdeep and beyond.

 

### The Long Road

 

Another major route connecting:

- Waterdeep to the south

- Triboar

- Longsaddle

- Mirabar in the north

 

### The High Road

 

Coastal route that has been recently restored, particularly the section near Neverwinter.

 

### River Trade

 

- **River Chionthar** - Connects Baldur's Gate to inland regions

- **River Dessarin** - Major waterway in the central North

- **River Surbrin** - Flows near Yartar

 

Yartar's barges are famous throughout the region, and the town's importance to river commerce earned it a place in the Lords' Alliance.

 

## Geographic Features

 

### Mountains

 

- **Spine of the World** - Northern mountain range, source of orc hordes

- **Sword Mountains** - Near Waterdeep

- **Ice Mountains** - Location of Citadel Adbar

 

### Forests

 

- **High Forest** - Ancient woodland, home to elves and other sylvan creatures

- **Neverwinter Wood** - Near Neverwinter

- **Cormanthor** - Elven forest to the east

 

### Other Features

 

- **Mount Waterdeep** - The great mountain around which Waterdeep is built

- **The Mere of Dead Men** - Swampy region

- **Anauroch** - The great desert to the east (formerly the Narrow Sea)

 

## Climate and Environment

 

The Sword Coast experiences harsh conditions:

 

> "In the harsh lands of the North, where winters are cold and monsters and human barbarians regularly stream out of the mountains to pillage outlying settlements, large nations are rare indeed." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

This climate has shaped the political landscape, favoring great city-states over large territorial nations.

 

## Political Landscape

 

### City-State Dominance

 

The region is characterized by independent city-states rather than large nations. These cities:

- Control their immediate surroundings

- Maintain trade relationships

- Cooperate through the Lords' Alliance

- Compete for influence and resources

 

### Independent Realms

 

Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and the settlements protected by the Lords' Alliance are significant sites that exist largely outside the protection or purview of the great powers:

- Elturgard (theocratic realm)

- Various ruins and wild territories

 

### Threats

 

The region faces constant threats from:

- Orc hordes from the mountains

- Northlander pirates

- Monsters from the wilderness

- Agents of Thay and the Zhentarim

 

## The Sea of Swords

 

The western coast of Faerûn, bordered by:

- The Sword Coast settlements

- The Moonshae Isles to the west

- Lantan and other islands

 

Major port cities include Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Luskan.

 

## Neverwinter: The Northern Anchor

 

Recently restored after volcanic eruption and various disasters:

- Mount Hotenow's eruption devastated the city

- The Chasm split the city

- Now under the protection of Lord Protector Dagult Neverember

- Rebuilding its military forces

- Seeking alliance with restored Gauntlgrym

 

The city represents the northern edge of "civilized" Sword Coast territory.

 

## Daggerford: The Gateway

 

Situated in an ideal location on the Trade Way:

- Midway point for caravans between Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate

- Provides repairs, supplies, and escort services

- Ruled by Lady Morwen Daggerford

- Historic connection to the realm of Phalorm

 

## The Uthgardt Barbarians

 

Human barbarian tribes that inhabit the wilderness areas of the North, occasionally raiding civilized settlements or hiring out for work at places like Yartar's Hiring Fair.

 

## Contradictions & Notes

 

- The exact boundaries of "the Sword Coast" vary between sources

- Some maps include territories farther north (Luskan, Icewind Dale) while others focus on the Neverwinter-Baldur's Gate corridor

- Political allegiances shift over time (e.g., Sundabar's withdrawal from the Lords' Alliance)

- The status of various ruins and wild territories changes with each major campaign

 

## Further Research Needed

 

- Detailed maps of trade routes

- Seasonal variations in travel and trade

- Specific distances between major settlements

- Natural resources of each region

- Monster populations and their territories

- Weather patterns and their effects on trade

- Sea routes and maritime trade

- The Underdark passages beneath the region

- Historical boundaries of elven kingdoms

- Ruins and dungeons of note

*Note: The Sword Coast represents civilization's tenuous hold on a wild land. The great cities are islands of order in a sea of wilderness, connected by trade routes that require constant protection. This geographic reality shapes everything about the region—its politics, its economy, and its character.*
