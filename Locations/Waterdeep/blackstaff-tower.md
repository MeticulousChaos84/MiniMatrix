## Overview

 

Blackstaff Tower is one of the most significant magical landmarks in Waterdeep, located in Castle Ward alongside other important civic structures. It serves as the residence and seat of power for the city's most powerful archmage, bearing the title of "the Blackstaff."

 

The tower is named after its most famous inhabitant, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, and has become synonymous with arcane power and the protection of Waterdeep through magic.

 

## Location

 

Blackstaff Tower stands in Castle Ward, Waterdeep's administrative district. Castle Ward's notable landmarks include:

 

- Ahghairon's Tower

- **Blackstaff Tower**

- Castle Waterdeep

- The Lords' Palace

- The Market

- The Cynosure

- New Olamn

 

The tower's location in Castle Ward places it at the heart of Waterdeep's government and power structure, reflecting the importance of arcane magic to the city's defense and administration.

 

## The Original Blackstaff: Khelben Arunsun

 

### Personal Details

 

**Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun**

- Alignment: Lawful Neutral

- Race: Human Male

- Class: Wizard (Level 27 in older editions)

 

Khelben was one of the most powerful and influential mages in all of Faerûn, frequently mentioned alongside Elminster as one of the preeminent wizards of the age.

 

> "Most of the old guard wizards like Khelben and Elminster are nonspecialized mages." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### Political Influence

 

Khelben was generally assumed to be one of the Lords of Waterdeep, and perhaps chief among them, exceeding even Piergeiron the Paladinson in influence:

 

> "It is generally assumed that the archmage Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun is also of the Lords, and perhaps chief among them, exceeding even Piergeiron." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

However, evidence existed to both prove and disprove his membership among the Lords, maintaining the mystery that surrounds all masked lords.

 

### Harper Connections

 

Khelben was a prominent member or ally of the Harpers, the organization dedicated to preserving balance and fighting tyranny:

 

> "Harper members or allies include such worthies as Khelben Arunsun, Elminster, Mourngrym of Shadowdale, and Lord Piergeiron of Waterdeep." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### Lords' Alliance Communications

 

Khelben served a crucial role in coordinating the Lords' Alliance through magical means:

 

> "The Alliance communicates through official envoys by means of the trained pigeons of Piergeiron the Unmasked Lord of Waterdeep and by the magical arts of Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun. In this way Alliance agents have successfully coordinated military operations against Zhentarim annexation." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### Notable Deeds

 

- **1336 DR (Year of the Saddle)**: Slew Jyordhan, leading to the Time of No Lords in Shadowdale (until 1348 DR)

- **1348 DR (Year of the Spur)**: Gave the Pendant of Ashaba to the Knights of Myth Drannor; offered lordship of Shadowdale to Florin Falconhand (who declined)

- Drove out bandits and outcast mages from Dragonspear Castle alongside his "colleagues in wizardry"

- Proposed Present Reckoning (PR) calendar system alongside Vangerdahast of Cormyr

 

### Academic Reputation

 

Khelben had a notable (and somewhat problematic) relationship with Candlekeep:

 

> "Both Elminster and Khelben are on probation after agents bearing their symbols engaged in a magical duel in the general reading room." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### Marriage to Laeral Silverhand

 

Khelben's wife was Laeral Silverhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters blessed by Mystra:

 

> "Laeral has recovered from an experience with an evil artifact under the care and tutelage of Khelben Arunsun, with whom she now lives." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

Laeral was described as his "consort" in earlier sources, and the two were known to reside together in Blackstaff Tower.

 

## The Seven Sisters Connection

 

The Seven Sisters are a remarkably powerful family blessed by Mystra with great power, long life, and wisdom. Laeral's connection to Khelben placed Blackstaff Tower at the intersection of some of the most powerful magical forces in Faerûn:

 

The Seven Sisters:

- Storm Silverhand, the Bard of Shadowdale

- Dove Falconhand, ranger and Knight of Myth Drannor

- The Simbul, Queen of Aglarond

- Alustriel, the High Lady of Silverymoon

- **Laeral**, consort to Khelben Arunsun

- Sylune, the witch of Shadowdale (deceased)

- An unknown seventh sister

 

## Current Era: Vajra Safahr

 

### The New Blackstaff

 

Following Khelben's death (the details of which vary between sources), the title and responsibilities of the Blackstaff passed to **Vajra Safahr**.

 

The relationship between Vajra and Laeral Silverhand (now Open Lord of Waterdeep) is described as cordial but distant:

 

> "Her relationship with the current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, is cordial, but the two are seldom seen in one-on-one conversation, and most think that Lady Laeral has little to learn from a mage who isn't nearly her equal." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

This suggests some tension or simply acknowledgment of the vast difference in their magical abilities and experience.

 

## Significance to Waterdeep

 

### Magical Defense

 

Blackstaff Tower represents the city's primary magical defense capability. The archmage who bears the title "Blackstaff" is expected to:

 

- Protect Waterdeep from magical threats

- Coordinate with the Lords on matters of arcane importance

- Maintain the city's magical defenses and wards

- Serve as a counterbalance to external magical powers (Red Wizards of Thay, Zhentarim, etc.)

 

### Symbol of Power

 

The tower serves as a visible reminder of Waterdeep's magical might. Its presence in Castle Ward, alongside the seats of political power, demonstrates that arcane and civic authority work hand in hand in the City of Splendors.

 

### Historical Continuity

 

The passing of the Blackstaff title from Khelben to Vajra represents the continuation of magical guardianship of Waterdeep. Despite the change in personnel, the institution endures.

 

## The Blackstaff (Artifact)

 

The title "Blackstaff" derives from a powerful magical staff that Khelben wielded. This artifact is presumably passed to each successor who takes on the role, though specific details about its powers and the succession process require further research.

 

## Contradictions & Notes

 

- The exact circumstances of Khelben's death and the succession to Vajra Safahr are not clearly detailed in the available sources

- Different editions present Khelben's alignment and level differently

- The relationship between Laeral (as Open Lord) and Vajra (as current Blackstaff) appears more complex than simple professional courtesy

- Some sources suggest Khelben was definitively a Lord of Waterdeep, while others maintain the ambiguity

 

## Further Research Needed

 

- Detailed history of the tower's construction

- Powers and properties of the Blackstaff artifact

- Complete list of those who have held the title of Blackstaff

- Architectural details of the tower

- Specific protective magics on the tower

- Vajra Safahr's background and how she came to inherit the title

- The circumstances of Khelben Arunsun's death

- Any apprentices or students trained at the tower

*Note: As a fellow practitioner of the arcane arts in Waterdeep, I find the legacy of Khelben Arunsun to be both inspiring and instructive. His integration of magical power with civic responsibility exemplifies what wizardry should aspire to be—not isolated scholarship, but engaged protection of civilization.*
