## Overview

 

The Lords of Waterdeep are the ruling council of the City of Splendors, a unique governmental system that combines transparency and secrecy in equal measure. Founded in 1032 DR by the archmage Ahghairon, the Lords have guided Waterdeep for over four centuries, maintaining the city's stability, prosperity, and independence.

 

## Historical Foundation

 

### The Founding (1032 DR)

 

In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, heir to the arts of Netheril, saved Waterdeep from itself by unseating the city's warlord and would-be emperor, Raurlor. Rather than claiming power for himself, Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created the Lords of Waterdeep.

 

> "Waterdeep, guided by its mysterious Lords, became a rising power, while old Illusk fell to the ores for decades, until it was eventually reclaimed and the city of Luskan built upon its ruins." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

### Philosophy of Governance

 

The system was designed to:

- Prevent tyranny by any single ruler

- Protect wise governance from assassination and intimidation

- Allow capable individuals to serve regardless of birth or wealth

- Maintain stability through secrecy

 

## Structure of Government

 

### The Open Lord

 

One Lord serves with their identity publicly known—the Open Lord. This individual:

- Chairs the Lords' Court

- Asks all questions (the Lords speak through them)

- Serves as the public face of government

- Coordinates with the Lords' Alliance and other powers

 

### The Masked Lords

 

The remaining Lords serve with their identities concealed. When appearing in public:

 

> "On such occasions there are always at least four Lords present, but sometimes six or seven are seen, and rarely as many as nine. Piergeiron chairs the Court and asks all questions, for the Lords speak through him. In chambers the Lords all appear similarly masked and robed, their robes formless and black, with black capes, and their masks completely covering the head and face. These masks have featureless faces, with mirrored crystals over the eyes." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

The masks and robes serve multiple purposes:

- Concealing identity from would-be assassins

- Allowing Lords to move freely in society without bias

- Preventing Lords from being bribed or threatened through family

- Creating an air of mystery that enhances the government's authority

 

### Selection Process

 

The Open Lord is selected and supported by the masked lords. The exact process for selecting new Lords (both Open and masked) is not publicly known, adding to the mystique of the institution.

 

## Historical Open Lords

 

### Piergeiron the Paladinson

 

**Full Title:** Warden of Waterdeep and Commander of the Watch

**Alignment:** Lawful Good

**Class:** Paladin (Level 14)

 

Piergeiron served as the Unmasked Lord during an earlier era, with his golden-spired palace dominating the center of the city. He was known for:

- Unwavering honor and integrity

- Direct leadership of the City Watch

- Wearing no disguise over either his face or his heart

 

Piergeiron had his mask's face covering separated, allowing him to speak directly while still wearing the ceremonial headpiece.

 

### Dagult Neverember

 

Neverember served as Open Lord but was eventually deposed. His tenure was marked by controversial decisions:

 

- Wasted the city's navy

- Hired sailors from Mintarn rather than rebuilding (while profiting from the arrangement)

- Made it legal for impoverished houses to sell their noble titles

- Eventually deposed and replaced by Laeral Silverhand

 

After his removal, Neverember threw his full attention into rebuilding Neverwinter, where he serves as Lord Protector.

 

### Laeral Silverhand (Current)

 

Long thought dead, Laeral reemerged and swiftly rallied the masked lords to support her supplanting of Dagult Neverember as Open Lord.

 

> "Very few remember Lady Laeral from her previous time in the city, but those elves who have been living in there for the last century claim she is more reserved than she once was. The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her family—any mention of her children, her late husband (the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever conversation may be in progress." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

Laeral represents Waterdeep on the Council of the Lords' Alliance and has reversed several of Neverember's more controversial policies.

 

## Suspected Masked Lords

 

### Known Suspicions

 

The Campaign Setting notes several individuals whose names "have been connected with the Lords, though evidence exists to both prove or disprove claims":

 

- **Mirt the Merchant** (CG hm F9) - Wealthy merchant

- **Larissa** (NG hf F4) - A courtesan

- **Texter the Paladin** (LG hm Pal17) - A holy warrior

- **Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun** - Generally assumed to be a Lord, perhaps chief among them

 

> "Beyond these four (including the Blackstaff) conjecture swings widely as to who is a Lord and who is not." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### The Nature of Suspicion

 

Every Waterdhavian has suspicions as to whether this or that influential citizen is or isn't a lord of the city. Some are willing to make their beliefs public, but:

 

> "Few who are confronted in such a way have ever claimed to be a lord, and none of those have also produced proof of that assertion." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

The Lords themselves set their own rumors afloat, further confusing matters and protecting their identities.

 

## The Lords' Court

 

### Jurisdiction

 

The Lords sit in judgment on:

- Murder

- Treason

- Misuse of magic

- Appeals from lower courts

 

### Procedure

 

The Lords' Court operates with the Open Lord (or Unmasked Lord) serving as the voice of the council. The masked Lords deliberate and decide, but their judgments are delivered through the Open Lord.

 

## Relationship with Other Institutions

 

### The Nobility

 

> "Not hidden at all are the other lords of the city—the nobles of Waterdeep, whose high-nosed behavior and heavy-handed spending establish fashion in the city." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

More than seventy-five noble families call Waterdeep home. While nobles wield tremendous economic and social power, they are subject to the authority of the Lords. One matter all noble houses agree on is that their status should not be tainted by newcomers purchasing titles.

 

### The Lords' Alliance

 

The Lords of Waterdeep are the most powerful members of the Lords' Alliance, a confederation of rulers of northern settlements. Waterdeep's Open Lord sits on the Council of Lords and the city's resources anchor the Alliance's military and economic strength.

 

> "The Lords' Alliance is not to be confused with the Lords of Waterdeep, though members of the latter belong to the former." - Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

 

### The Blackstaff

 

The archmage bearing the title of Blackstaff has historically worked closely with the Lords, providing magical expertise and communication capabilities for the Lords' Alliance.

 

### The City Watch and Guard

 

The Lords command both the City Watch (police) and City Guard (army), with the Open Lord traditionally holding the title of Commander of the Watch.

 

## The Code Legal

 

While specific laws are not detailed in the available sources, the Lords maintain Waterdeep's legal code. Certain activities are prohibited:

 

- Worship of certain evil gods is forbidden (though private worship by individuals is tolerated)

- Living or digging below the city's surface is illegal except by authorization

- Misuse of magic is subject to the Lords' Court

 

## Symbols and Regalia

 

The Lords wear:

- Formless black robes

- Black capes

- Masks completely covering head and face

- Featureless face masks with mirrored crystals over eyes

- Amulets (for disguising identity)

 

These items serve both practical and ceremonial purposes, making the Lords indistinguishable from one another during official proceedings.

 

## Contradictions & Notes

 

- The exact number of Lords varies between sources and time periods (minimum of four, sometimes six or seven, rarely nine)

- Some sources treat Khelben's membership as fact, others as speculation

- The transition between Open Lords is not always clear or smooth

- Different eras show different individuals suspected of being Lords

 

## Further Research Needed

- The relationship between Lords and the various city guilds

- Details of the Code Legal

- The amulets worn by Lords and their magical properties

*Note: The genius of Ahghairon's system lies in its balance—transparency where it serves the people (the Open Lord), secrecy where it protects good governance (the masked Lords). Four centuries of relative stability speak to the wisdom of this arrangement.*
