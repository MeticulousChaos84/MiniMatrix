## Overview

 

Rising from the shores of its deep harbor to ring the great mountain standing tall out of the Sea of Swords is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors and the Crown of the North. To all of Faerûn, this great metropolis stands as the pinnacle of what a great city might be, in wealth, influence, and stability.

 

> "Here, the citizens work, the nobles sneer, and the great masked lords plot and scheme, all while merchants dance between them to collect their coins and continue profiting as best they can." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

The city's shops and merchants offer goods of every sort from every corner of Toril, and even the rarest of items can be procured, given sufficient coin and patience. Adventurers lacking one or the other can very easily find all manner of employment, from simple escorting of caravans, to guarding nobility, to investigating ruins or rumors of monsters anywhere in the North.

 

## Historical Foundation

 

### Origins: Nimoar's Hold

 

The site of Waterdeep was originally settled by humans who built a fortified settlement in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep. The deep bay was named Nimoar's Hold, after the Uthgardt chieftain who claimed the area and fortified it. The place became known to sea captains as "Waterdeep," a name that displaced the original within a few generations.

 

### Pre-Human History

 

Before human settlement, the area had elven significance. The elves of Illefarn settled along the Sword Coast, from the Spine of the World to the River Delimbiyr, with their capital Aelinthaldaar in the shadow of what is now Mount Waterdeep.

 

### The Founding of the Lords (1032 DR)

 

In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, heir to the arts of Netheril, saved the city from itself by unseating Waterdeep's warlord and would-be emperor, Raurlor. Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created the Lords of Waterdeep.

 

> "The four and a half centuries since the establishment of the Lords of Waterdeep have been tumultuous times for the Sword Coast and the world." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

## The Wards of Waterdeep

 

Waterdeep has long been divided into several large regions called wards. To locals these are essential to Waterdeep, but outsiders often lose track of which ward they're in or what a ward's name signifies. The names of the wards suggest the contents of the buildings and the character of the activity in each one, but no laws exist that restrict a given activity or class of people to any specific ward.

 

### Castle Ward

 

As the name indicates, Castle Ward contains Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron's Palace, and many other public buildings of the city. This ward is home to mainly the wealthy or influential who can't count themselves among the nobility. Other structures are taken up by educational or religious concerns that primarily serve the city at large.

 

**Notable Landmarks:**

- Ahghairon's Tower

- Blackstaff Tower

- Castle Waterdeep

- The Lords' Palace

- The Market

- The Cynosure

- New Olamn

 

### Dock Ward

 

Most of the city's harbor area is located in Dock Ward, as are the businesses and warehouses that depend on the city's newly restored harbor. It's a crowded neighborhood of many winding streets, where folk are comfortable making deals that might in other places provoke the displeasure of the law.

 

### Field Ward

 

Of relatively recent vintage, the Field Ward stands between the inner and outer north walls of the city (an area formerly used as a caravan grounds). This ward grew up in a messy, unregulated fashion and is home to many of the poorest residents of the city.

 

### North Ward

 

Home to many noble villas, townhouses, and a great many inns, North Ward is the neighborhood of the respectably wealthy.

 

### Sea Ward

 

Those whose fortunes are on the rise build their homes in Sea Ward, and they join many long-established noble families in residence. This area in the northwest of the city is home to much of the city's wealth, the location of the grandest villas of the city's noble families (except for those in North Ward).

 

### Southern Ward

 

Stables, warehouses, and shops related to overland trade dominate Southern Ward. Most residents are hardworking folk that load and unload caravan carts, and otherwise perform low-paying work.

 

### Trades Ward

 

A narrow slice of land between the Castle Ward and the City of the Dead, Trades Ward is the center of commerce for the city, with most of the smaller transactions and respectable trade taking place here.

 

### City of the Dead

 

The city's walled cemetery, the City of the Dead is the only place in Waterdeep where it is legal to bury the deceased. It is used by many citizens as a public park during the day, a lovely green space of pretty mausoleums and grand statues in which to escape the city's hustle and bustle.

 

### Undercliff

 

While not considered by many to be a ward of the city, the little villages and many farms that sprawl across the land east of the city were lawfully incorporated into Waterdeep when it moved a barracks and training facility to the area.

 

## Government and Leadership

 

### Current Leadership

 

The current Open Lord of Waterdeep is **Laeral Silverhand**, who reemerged after being long thought dead and swiftly rallied the masked lords to support her supplanting of Dagult Neverember as Open Lord.

 

> "Very few remember Lady Laeral from her previous time in the city, but those elves who have been living in there for the last century claim she is more reserved than she once was." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her family—any mention of her children, her late husband (the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever conversation may be in progress.

 

### The Masked Lords

 

The Open Lord is selected and supported by several masked lords, who bear masks, robes, and amulets to disguise themselves when publicly sitting in judgment or council, and who make policies for Waterdeep. Every Waterdhavian has suspicions as to whether this or that influential citizen is or isn't a lord of the city.

 

### The Nobility

 

More than seventy-five noble families call Waterdeep home, representing between them all manner of business interests, rivalries, and internal strife. Being a noble carries with it a great deal of advantage—a noble can easily lift a mediocre craftperson out of obscurity, dash the hopes of a wealthy merchant of ever securing another contract within the city, or provide the backing an ambitious adventuring band needs to find fame and great wealth.

 

## Military and Defense Forces

 

The city maintains several defensive organizations:

 

- **City Guard** - The city's army

- **City Watch** - Police force

- **Navy** - Recently restored after Neverember's mismanagement

- **Griffon Cavalry** - Famous aerial defense force

 

All of these are currently being reformed following recent troubles.

 

## Economy and Trade

 

### Coinage

 

Waterdeep has its own coins:

 

- **Nib** (copper piece equivalent)

- **Shard** (silver piece equivalent)

- **Sambar** (electrum piece equivalent)

- **Dragon** (gold piece equivalent)

- **Sun** (platinum piece equivalent)

 

Special coins:

- **Taol** - A square piece of brass, worth 2 dragons in the city—and virtually worthless to anyone not trading with Waterdeep. Most traders exchange their taols for standard coins before traveling.

- **Harbor Moon** - A palm-sized crescent of platinum inset with electrum, worth 50 dragons in the city, 30 elsewhere.

 

### Trade Position

 

Waterdeep is a member of the Lords' Alliance and serves as one of the most powerful mercantile centers in the North. The city's position on the Sword Coast makes it a crucial hub for trade between the North and the South.

 

## Cultural Character

 

Waterdhavians are a tolerant and law-abiding people. Visitors to the city are often surprised to learn that racial tensions are largely absent in the City of Splendors.

 

### Religion

 

In cosmopolitan places such as Waterdeep, small shrines and temples to strange gods spring up from time to time. Although worship of certain evil gods (like Talona) is forbidden in Waterdeep, this prohibition extends only to the creation of a temple and the presence of her priesthood within the city.

 

The city has true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.

 

## Recent History

 

### The Time of Troubles

 

The recent disruptions began when the gods walked the Realms and slew each other before the eyes of mortals, until they walked back to their divine domains through the very streets of Waterdeep itself.

 

### Neverember's Tenure

 

Lord Neverember wasted the city's navy and then, instead of rebuilding it, hired sailors out of Mintarn (and profited from the endeavor). He also made it legal for impoverished houses to sell their titles, allowing others to purchase nobility.

 

### The Restoration

 

Now, the City of Splendors is on the mend:

- The harbor has been cleared of the broken ships that made up the former district of Mistshore

- Waterdeep again has its own navy

- The city's Guard, Watch, Navy, and Griffon Cavalry are all being reformed

- A plague chased most residents out of the Warrens and Downshadow

- Living or digging below the city's surface has been deemed illegal except by those authorized by the lords

 

Open Lord Laeral Silverhand has reversed Neverember's policy of selling noble titles and restored titles and lands to noble families who lost them through folly.

 

## Undermountain

 

Beneath Waterdeep lies Undermountain, the vast dungeon complex created by the Mad Mage Halaster Blackcloak. The many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain are considered a mythal by some.

 

## Contradictions & Notes

 

- Different sources give varying levels of detail about the number of wards (some count 7 official wards, others mention additional areas like Undercliff)

- The exact number of masked lords varies between sources and time periods

- Some sources focus on the 4th edition era (with different political situations) vs 5th edition current events

 

## Further Research Needed

 

- Detailed history of each ward's development

- Complete list of noble families and their specialties

- The Walking Statues of Waterdeep

- Specific laws and the Code Legal

- The magisters ("Black Robes") and judicial system

- Guilds and their influence

- Festivals and cultural events

- The Yawning Portal and access to Undermountain
