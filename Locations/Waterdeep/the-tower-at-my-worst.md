# The Tower As It Stands (Isolation Year, 1491 DR)
*Setting description for Arykah's arrival*

---

## Approaching From The Street

The townhouse sits in that cluster of terraced homes overlooking Deepwater Harbor - the ones that cling to the rocky slope like barnacles, connected to each other through shared walls and decades of neighborly accommodation. You'd remember the walk, even after ten years. The way the street curves as it descends toward Mistshore, how the salt air gets thicker with each step closer to the water.

The door is Cormyrian oak, dark with age and salt exposure, fitted with brass hardware that's gone slightly green from the sea air. There's an arcane lock on it - you'd feel that immediately, that particular tingle of protection wards. But they're... sluggish. Not maintained. Like the magical equivalent of rust.

The door knocker is shaped like an open book, pages spread. It used to shine. Now it's tarnished.

*You'd remember when he installed that. So proud of the metaphor.*

No lights visible through the windows. Heavy curtains drawn on all floors - the kind of deliberate darkness that's meant to keep the world out rather than just block sun.

If you're magically sensitive (and as a chaos sorceress, you absolutely are), you'd FEEL the wrongness before Tara even tells you how to bypass the wards. Something hungry. Something vast and terrible contained in too-small space. Like standing outside a building that houses a caged storm.

*That's new. That wasn't here ten years ago.*

## Through The Door (Ground Floor)

The entry hall is dusty. That's the first thing that hits you - the stillness of air that hasn't circulated properly in months. No servants moving through. No Tara's wing-beats stirring things up. Just... stagnant magic and accumulated neglect.

The coat rack by the door still has robes hanging on it. Multiple robes. As if he keeps putting on a fresh one rather than dealing with laundry. 

The floor - beautiful parquet that he was so proud of, reclaimed from a merchant ship's captain's quarters - is scuffed and dusty. Boot prints that track from door to stairs to... nowhere else. Just those two destinations, over and over.

*He's not leaving. He's barely moving.*

The walls are lined with those small sculptures he collected - protective enchantments disguised as art. You'd remember him explaining the theory behind them, how beauty and utility aren't mutually exclusive. They're still active, still humming with low-grade warding magic.

But everything is covered in a fine layer of dust that catches in the shaft of light from the opened door.

The dining area (to the right, through an archway) is untouched. The table - that massive thing that could seat twelve - has a single place setting at one end. Plate, glass, silverware. All clean but gathering dust. As if he set it out for a meal he never ate and then just... left it there.

*The wine cellar entrance is here somewhere - that pocket dimension he was so proud of creating. You'd remember him showing it off, explaining the preservation charms, the temperature regulation. The door's probably sealed. Locked. Unused.*

## The Staircase

The stairs wind up through the center of the townhouse - ship's stairs, narrow and steep, designed for sailors who knew how to move in confined spaces. Your hand would remember the bannister. Smooth dark wood, worn from decades of palms sliding along it.

But now there are scorch marks on it. Small ones. Irregular. Like someone's magic got away from them while climbing.

*That's very, very wrong. That's not something Gale does. His control was always flawless.*

Each floor you pass:

**Second Floor (Kitchen/Galley):** The smell hits you before you see it. Not rot - he's maintaining basic preservation charms - but *absence*. No cooking smells. No bread baking. No wine breathing. Just cold, sterile nothing. The kitchen that he used to take such joy in (because of course he approaches cooking like experimental spell research) is pristine. Untouched. The hearth is cold.

**Third Floor (Study/Library):** This is where you'd expect to find him. Where he lives when he's not sleeping. The door is ajar.

Books everywhere. But not organized - scattered. Stacked. Piled on every surface. Open books left spine-up (which he NEVER did - you'd remember him lecturing about proper book care). Research notes pinned to walls with minor levitation charms that are starting to fail, so paper drifts down occasionally like snow.

The balcony doors (the ones that open onto that view of the harbor he loves so much) are curtained. Heavy fabric blocking out the moonlight.

*The piano is silent. Dust on the keys. That's worse than anything else somehow - the piano he enchanted to play automatically, now just... quiet.*

Tara's cushion by the reading chair is the only clean thing in the room. She's been maintaining her own space even if she can't make him maintain his.

## What You'd FEEL (Magically)

The whole tower thrums with contained energy. Not the healthy buzz of active wards and enchantments, but something darker. Pressure building behind a dam. Wild magic in the worst sense - chaotic, hungry, barely leashed.

*It's coming from upstairs. From the personal chambers. From wherever he is.*

Every preservation charm, every protective ward, every bit of ambient magic in the building is slowly being drained. Like the tower itself is being cannibalized to feed something that's never satisfied.

A chaos sorceress would recognize it immediately: magical starvation. Not in him - he's the source. But everything around him is being consumed by proximity.

## The Fourth Floor (Personal Chambers)

Tara probably stops you at the base of these stairs. Warns you. Tells you he doesn't want to see anyone, that he's dangerous now, that he's convinced himself he's a weapon that needs to be contained.

The stairs to his chambers are the narrowest in the house. Almost like climbing into a ship's crow's nest. At the top is a door.

*This* door has active wards. Fresh ones. Powerful ones. Not to keep people out - to keep something IN.

Through it, you'd hear... nothing. No movement. No sound.

Just the occasional crackle of arcane energy struggling against containment.

The widow's walk - that balcony that swoops out over the harbor - is accessible from his chambers. You'd remember it. The telescope. The view of Selûne's Tears reflecting off the water. The way he used to stand out there at night, watching stars and ships and thinking whatever thoughts brilliant wizards think when they're in love and happy.

*That balcony is sealed now. Curtains drawn. The telescope probably hasn't been touched in months.*

---

**The overall impression:** This is a tomb. A beautiful, artifact-filled, magically-sophisticated tomb where something that used to be Gale of Waterdeep has buried itself alive.

Everything you'd remember - the warmth, the life, the joy he took in his collection and his home and his work - is still here in structure but absent in spirit.

*He's somewhere in those chambers. Probably hasn't come down in days. Possibly sitting in darkness feeding magical items to the thing in his chest, trying to buy himself another week before he has to face the choice between detonation and starvation.*

That's what Tara's brought you into.

That's what you're about to try to save.
