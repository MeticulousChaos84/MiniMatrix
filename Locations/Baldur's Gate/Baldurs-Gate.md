## Overview

 

Home to tens of thousands, Baldur's Gate is a harbor city with poor soil but an ideal location for trade. Its sheltered bay, well away from the tides that batter the coast, makes it perfect for trading goods from locations to the west in the Sea of Swords, inland along the River Chionthar, and up and down the coast.

 

> "Baldur's Gate is a place of commerce, and the city enjoys great success handling the coins of other powers and making them its own." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

The city defines the southern extent of the Sword Coast proper and serves as a major member of the Lords' Alliance.

 

## The Shadow of Bhaal

 

Baldur's Gate has a storied and tragic connection with the dark god Bhaal, Lord of Murder.

 

### The Return of Bhaal (1482 DR)

 

The first indication of new turmoil in the Realms came in 1482 DR, when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead.

 

> "Following a number of deaths, one of the city's dukes, Torlin Silvershield, was revealed as the Chosen of Bhaal, and underwent a monstrous transformation, turning many citizens into bloodthirsty killers and inspiring a riot and much death before finally being put down by brave adventurers." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

### Ongoing Consequences

 

Even now, murderous echoes ripple through the city and beyond, and reports of unexplainable, gruesome killings flow out of Baldur's Gate.

 

## Government: The Council of Four

 

Baldur's Gate is ruled by the **Council of Four**, dukes who vote among themselves on matters of law and policy for the city. A single **Grand Duke** is chosen from among the four and is empowered to break ties when the council is deadlocked.

 

### Current Leadership

 

**Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard** - The current Grand Duke, also serving as Marshal of the Flaming Fist mercenary company.

 

**Duke Thalamra Vanthampur** - One of the current dukes (additional details vary by source and time period).

 

Other duke positions exist but their occupants change over time, particularly following the Bhaal crisis which killed at least two dukes.

 

### Lords' Alliance Representation

 

Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard represents Baldur's Gate on the Council of the Lords' Alliance.

 

## City Districts

 

### Upper City

 

The Upper City is the enclosed haven of the city's nobility—the **patriars**. Sitting atop their hill, the patriars look down on the rest of Baldur's Gate in every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence to push the Council of Four to protect their lifestyle.

 

#### The Patriars

 

- Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of the patriars, there is no longer room, physically or otherwise, for the class of the Upper City to grow

- Only those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors of this oldest part of Baldur's Gate

- The poorest among these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations from inside their homes to keep up appearances

- Lives of patriars are marked by luxury and decadence

- Only one nonhuman family among the patriars: the dwarven Shattershields, who have been in Baldur's Gate long enough to be just as accomplished as their human peers at looking down on the citizenry

 

#### The Famous Gate

 

The famous Baldur's Gate, from which the city takes its name, stands between the Upper and Lower Cities. Trade passes freely through this portal, but individuals that aren't in the presence of a patriar, wearing a patriar's livery, or bearing a letter of proof of employment by a patriar must use Baldur's Gate to pass between the Upper and Lower Cities.

 

#### Security

 

The **Watch** guards the Upper City, existing primarily to defend the patriars and enforce their laws.

 

### Lower City

 

Hard against the harbor lies the Lower City, where stone, slate-roofed houses stand (sometimes unsteadily), and the folk who have long performed the real work of the city reside.

 

#### Harbor Economy

 

Baldur's Gate depends on trade, and that trade flows in and out of the Gray Harbor. The hands that load and unload ships, that tally cargo and haul goods, that repair keels and mend sails, all live here.

 

#### Atmosphere

 

The damp clings heavily in this portion of the city—some say it's held in by the Old Wall—and lamps (lit and tended) burn throughout the day to pierce the fog and gloom.

 

#### Social Mobility

 

Where merchants in other cities might hope to one day join the nobility, in Baldur's Gate the best one can hope for is to become an absurdly wealthy and influential merchant. Becoming a patriar is out of the question.

 

The wealthiest Baldurians live as much like the patriars as they can, buying up adjacent properties in hopes of demolishing them to build larger homes.

 

#### Security

 

The **Flaming Fist** is responsible for keeping order in the Lower City, and do so with brutal efficiency, deterring most from engaging in bold, public acts of theft, vandalism, or violence.

 

### Outer City

 

Outside the walls, there are no laws barring construction or settlement. Those who are too poor to reside within the city or to purchase property have slowly built up a third ward of the city, living in the shadow of its walls, paying its taxes, and covering both sides of the roads leading into Baldur's Gate.

 

Here, the poorest of the poor live, but so too do those whose businesses are considered too troublesome for the inner city.

 

## Military Forces

 

### The Flaming Fist

 

The Flaming Fist is a supposedly neutral mercenary company which is free to fight in external conflicts, so long as it doesn't side against Baldur's Gate.

 

- **Tradition:** By tradition, the highest officer of the Flaming Fist is one of the city's dukes

- **Current Leader:** Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard fulfills that tradition proudly

- **Membership:** Fairly easy to achieve; adventurers with much experience swiftly advance in rank (and, consequently, political influence)

- **Jurisdiction:** Responsible for keeping order in the Lower City

 

### The Watch

 

A separate force from the Flaming Fist, the Watch guards the Upper City and primarily serves the patriars' interests.

 

## Criminal Element: The Guild

 

Efforts to destroy the Guild (the local thieves' guild) have thus far failed, due in part to:

- The inability of outsiders to identify a clear leader of the group

- The shameful lack of effort on the part of the rulers of the city to protect its people

 

The Guild represents one of the city's ongoing problems with criminal activity.

 

## Religion

 

### Worship of Gond

 

The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies in Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two huge structures in honor of the Wonderbringer:

 

- **High House of Wonders** - A temple

- **Hall of Wonders** - A museum of craft and design

 

### Worship of Umberlee

 

Baldur's Gate has true temples dedicated to Umberlee, the Queen of the Depths, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.

 

## Trade and Economy

 

### Position in Trade Networks

 

Baldur's Gate serves as a crucial link in Sword Coast trade:

- Gateway between the North and the South

- Connection between sea trade and inland river trade via the Chionthar

- Member of the Lords' Alliance, ensuring trade protections

 

### Comparison to Waterdeep

 

> "Although the nation is richer by far than even the northern metropolises of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of its rulers to work together in the nation's best interest." - (referring to Amn)

 

This comparison suggests Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep are roughly equivalent in wealth and influence among Sword Coast cities.

 

### Banking

 

Baldur's Gate is one of the cities connected by the Traders' Bank network, which uses magical means of communicating precise amounts of currency between cities.

 

## Historical Notes

 

### Founding

 

The city takes its name from the famous gate that divides the Upper and Lower Cities—itself a remnant of when the Upper City was overthrown by its first dukes and the Lower City was enclosed by its ring wall.

 

### Plague (Year of the Crown - 1351 DR)

 

A plague struck Baldur's Gate in 1351 DR, as noted in historical records.

 

## Relationship with Other Powers

 

### Lords' Alliance

 

Baldur's Gate is a member of the Lords' Alliance:

 

> "The current members of the Alliance are Amphail, Baldur's Gate, Daggerford, Longsaddle, Mirabar, Mithral Hall, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

 

### Trade Rivals

 

Some in Silverymoon consider the city's tolerance of members like Baldur's Gate to be "somewhat naive," suggesting tensions or distrust within the Alliance.

 

### Regional Position

 

Baldur's Gate stands at the southern edge of what is typically considered the Sword Coast, serving as a gateway to the lands of Amn and the south.

 

## Contradictions & Notes

 

- The exact composition of the Council of Four changes between sources and time periods

- The relationship between the Watch and Flaming Fist jurisdiction is sometimes unclear

- Different sources give varying levels of detail about the patriar families

- The events of Descent into Avernus significantly alter the city's leadership and situation

 

## Further Research Needed

 

- Complete list of patriar families

- Detailed history of the founding and the original dukes

- Specific neighborhoods and locations within each district

- The Old Wall and its history

- Criminal organizations beyond the Guild

- Trade routes and primary goods

- Relationship with Amn and other southern powers

- The history of the Flaming Fist's formation

- Details of the Bhaal crisis and its aftermath

- Harbor facilities and shipbuilding industry

*Research compiled by Gale Dekarios, Archmage of Waterdeep, for the Blackstaff Academy Lexicon Project*

 

*Note: While Waterdeep may be the Crown of the North, Baldur's Gate serves as our southern counterpart—a city of commerce rather than splendor, of dukes rather than lords. The contrast is instructive: where Waterdeep conceals its rulers behind masks, Baldur's Gate elevates its wealthy to visible thrones. Both systems have their merits and their failures.*
