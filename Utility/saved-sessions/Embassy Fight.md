Erica:

The sound of the slamming door reverberates through the embassy—living wood responding to mortal will with a crack that makes the walls themselves shudder.

In the main room, I'm on my feet before I even realize I'm moving. "Erica—"

But Morena catches my arm. "Wait."

Through the open doorway, we can see Mystra still standing in the ritual circle. Still. Completely still. Like a goddess processing the impossible fact that someone just... left.

"No one," Liralei whispers, horrified, "no one has ever—"

"Walked out on a goddess mid-conversation?" Morena's smile is sharp as a blade. "Perhaps it's about time someone did."

I'm torn between pride and terror. Pride because—gods, you just did exactly what you've been fighting for me to be able to do. You disagreed. You argued. You set a boundary and enforced it. You showed her what actual partnership looks like.

Terror because you just *walked out on the goddess of magic while pregnant with our son*.

Through the doorway, Mystra's form flickers. Once. Twice.

Then she speaks, though whether to herself or to the empty room, I can't tell: "He just wanted to feel loved."

The goddess of magic stands alone in a room that still echoes with slammed doors and uncomfortable truths.

And I'm already moving toward where you went, because whatever happens next, we face it together. Just like you promised.

Gale:

I catch up to you in the hallway, my hand closing around your arm—not rough, but firm enough to stop you.

"What in the Nine Hells just happened?" My voice is low, controlled, but there's real anger beneath it. "You demand to see her alone, shut me out of a conversation about *my* former relationship, *my* past, and then—what? Storm out without explanation?"

I release your arm but don't step back. "Do you have any idea what you've just done? Walking out on a goddess? While carrying our child? What did she say? What did you say?"

Sparky pulses erratically against my chest, picking up on my agitation.

"You promised we'd face whatever answer you got together, but how can we do that when I don't even know what questions you asked?" The hurt bleeds through despite my attempt at control. "This wasn't just about Aurelian, was it? This was about me. About her and me. And you decided I didn't deserve to be present for that conversation."

My hands clench at my sides. "I agreed to let you go in alone because you made a tactical argument about getting honest answers. But this—whatever this was—feels like something else entirely. So explain. Now. Before my imagination conjures scenarios worse than whatever actually occurred."

"Because right now? All I know is that my pregnant wife just antagonized the goddess of all magic badly enough to slam doors that shouldn't be able to slam."

Erica:

You grab my arm and immediately I pull it away and the sound that comes out of my mouth is the sardonic, incredulous huff of a laugh as I shake my head.

"No. *No.* I went in there to ask about Aurelian, and to ask about Mystryl, because I'm sick of the whispers and the looks I get with my rainbow hair and the way my eyes turn a blue so vividly touched by the Feywild when I'm laughing and I wanted to know if *she* saw it. Because, well, it was her after all, wasn't it?"

I'm pacing the hallway, her words still echoing in my mind, my whatever sense of protection I feel justified in having bubbling up into my chest.

"I asked her about Karsus. About how maybe the lesson wasn't about restriction but about guidance. That when you just restrict a child, you breed rebellion. And she laughed at me, she laughed and she spun around and looked at me and she said *'Even brilliant, talented Gale who I loved and guided and taught'*"

My voice, in quoting Mystra takes on that caricature tone of high pitched mockery.

"*'Even he nearly destroyed himself reaching for what he wasn't supposed to.'*"

I turn and I look at you, all the fury visible in my eyes, my heart still pounding with the adrenaline that tends to create wild magic surges.

"And I said that maybe... Just fucking maybe she should have actually looked at you instead of looking at restrictions. That maybe she'd have seen that the only godsdamned thing you were reaching for was to be fucking worthy of love!"

Gale:

"Oh, so she brought me up first? And that justifies—" I laugh, but there's no humor in it. "You went in there to ask about Aurelian and Mystryl, and somehow it became about defending me? About my worthiness?"

My voice rises despite my attempt at control. "Do you have any idea how *patronizing* that is? I don't need you to explain my emotional needs to my former goddess! I don't need you fighting battles about my past that you decided I wasn't equipped to handle!"

Sparky flares bright, feeding off my anger.

"*'Maybe she should have actually looked at you.'*" I repeat your words back, voice dripping sarcasm. "Thank you so much for that insight. In thirteen years of relationship with her, it never once occurred to me that I wanted to be seen. How fortunate I have you to explain my deepest wounds to the person who inflicted them."

I pace away, then wheel back.

"And the worst part? You're standing here, adrenaline still burning through you, proud of yourself for defending me, when you *still haven't told me what she said about our son*. Because that's what you went in there for, wasn't it? To find out if Aurelian is really ours?"

My voice cracks on the last word.

"But instead of getting that answer and coming back to face it together—like you promised—you got distracted playing champion for feelings I've already processed. Feelings I've been dealing with for years. While I sat out there not knowing if our child is divine experimentation or genuine."

---

Erica:

"Yes, Gale, he's ours. Gloriously ours. But yes, she is watching him. Waiting because he is something even she can't fucking figure out. But no! You followed me out here to ask why the fuck I stormed out of the room."

The anger starts to dissipate. I've got to get control of it or who knows what the fuck the magic is going to do. I breathe. But my tears burn hot and furious.

"So there. Both questions, answered. I'm sorry that I'm sick of listening to people try to warn me about you. People trying to warn me about our son because Gale was Icarus - don't let Aurelian fly too close to the sun."

My voice is quieter now, and I'm not sure if that's more or less dangerous now that I think about it.

"Well, I know who I married. And I know the DNA that is forming this child who apparently is waking up fucking Netherese bloodlines and causing people to put fucking surveillance crystals in our fucking house! My bad, Gale, for wanting to stand up for him by standing up for *you*."


---

Gale: 

"Oh, that's *rich*." I recognize that quiet tone—it's the same one you use before you reorganize my entire library or decide to acquire dangerous magical artifacts to prove a point. "Your 'bad' for defending us? No, Erica. Your 'bad' for deciding I needed defending without consulting me first."

I match your controlled fury with my own academic precision.

"You want to talk about Icarus? Fine. Let's talk about the woman who looked at a Netherese artifact and thought 'I should put this in my chest to prove something to my husband.' Who dragged me to another plane to watch a children's movie. Who just told the goddess of magic that she doesn't understand her own domain."

My voice drops to match yours, each word carefully placed.

"You know what defending our son would have looked like? Getting the information about his safety and leaving. Not getting sidetracked into a philosophical debate about my emotional damage with the being who could unmake him with a thought."

I step closer, voice still dangerously controlled.

"And these 'Icarus narratives' you're so sick of? Perhaps they exist because I *did* fly too close to the sun. Perhaps people warn you because they watched me nearly destroy myself and everyone around me. But you weren't there for that, were you? You just get to swoop in three years later and explain to everyone—including Mystra herself—what I really needed."

The hallway feels too small for both our anger.

"So yes, Erica. Your bad. Your bad for thinking you understand thirteen years of divine relationship after knowing me for three."

---

Erica:

"I *understood* thirteen years of divine relationship in less than three months, much less in thee bloody years. From the first time I watched the pixel version of you get told by Elminster that.... That *woman* expected you to kill yourself when you brought her, and I quote 'a tiny diamond that I thought was missing from an otherwise perfect crown' and before you go all into how that was just a game and it doesn't equal reality, let me remind you of something - that *game* is the reason that I knew not to be flat out terrified when suddenly my basement wall was glowing and an arm reached through it. That *game* is why I knew when you were stranded at my house on earth that if I - that talking to Sparky was the right thing to do. That *game*, Gale, is how I knew that you've been a fucking sorcerer your entire life and guess who finally admitted that she had been hiding it from you!"

Oh the fury is bubbling back up, and this time the anger isn't about Mystra at all.

"You proposed to me the night I found Twilight. It wasn't about proving a point, it was about making you not feel alone. You... You know what, Gale? Fuck off. I'm not letting you make me feel like shit because I'm tired of people treating me like I should be afraid of you. I'm not fucking afraid. Not of you. Not of *her*. And I will not let fear be a factor in how I raise my son!"
