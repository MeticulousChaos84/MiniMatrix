The voice comes from the *alcove* and my head snaps up so fast something in my neck pops.

She didn't—

She *bypassed the door entirely*.

Of course she did. Of course she *remembered*. The abcd corner, the displacement passage, the route we used when we were young and stupid and thought sneaking past wards was romantic instead of concerning. When the worst danger in this room was getting caught by Morena during breakfast hours, not—

She sees me.

I watch her face change. Watch the memories of the alcove shift to *present*, to what's sitting here in the dark like some kind of wretched creature who's forgotten what daylight looks like. I know what she sees—I haven't looked in a mirror in days but I can *feel* it. The hollow ache in my bones, the way my clothes hang wrong, the fact that I can't remember when I last bathed or ate or did anything other than sit here feeding magical items to the *thing* in my chest and hoping it might buy me another few hours.

"Oh me gods, what happened—"

"*No*—"

She's *moving*. Crossing toward me with that determined healer's stride I remember too well, and every instinct I have screams *danger* but not for me, for *her*, and I'm scrambling to my feet before conscious thought catches up. My legs don't work right—weakness, disuse, too many days without proper food—and I knock over the small table beside me, magical item fragments scattering with small crystalline sounds as their drained husks hit the floor.

"Ember, *STOP*—"

But she's not stopping, she's still coming, and Sparky *feels* her. Feels the wild magic signature that used to make me want to study it, understand it, and now it just feels like *food*, like something the orb wants to *consume*, and the surge hits me like a fist to the sternum.

I gasp, double over, hand flying to my chest and pressing hard over the mark. Through my disheveled shirt—buttons undone, stained with gods know what—there's *light*. Indigo-bright, that starburst pattern I've been hiding from everyone suddenly illuminating the darkness like a curse made visible.

Pulsing. *Hungry*.

"*Arylë*—" Her name comes out as warning and plea and *prayer* all at once. "You can't—it's not safe—you need to STAY BACK—"

I'm backing up but there's nowhere to go. My shoulders hit the wall, then the corner where wall meets window, and I'm trapped there with one hand pressed to my chest like I can somehow contain this through sheer desperation, the other held out toward her palm-first in a warding gesture that would be laughable if it weren't so *necessary*.

The light pulses brighter and I make a sound I don't recognize, something animal and wounded, and my knees try to buckle again but I lock them because if I go down she'll just close the distance faster.

"There's—" I try to find words through the pain, through the *wanting* that isn't mine but lives in my chest anyway. "In Menzoberranzen I—there was a book—Netherese tome—thought it was—"

My voice cracks completely. I can't get the explanation out. Can't make the words form coherently when Sparky is screaming at me to *let her closer*, to stop fighting, to just *take* what it needs from that beautiful wild signature she's always carried.

She can see it now. Can see the scattered fragments of magical items I've been feeding to this thing—a sending stone reduced to cracked quartz, the husk of what used to be a ring of protection, a wand that's nothing but charred wood. Can see the way the glow in my chest intensifies as she gets closer, the way I'm shaking with the effort of staying upright and keeping distance between us.

Can see what I've become.

"It wants—" Another surge and I actually whimper, sliding down the wall a few inches before catching myself. "The magic—yours especially—wild magic is—"

I can't. I can't finish sentences. Can barely think through the *hunger*.

"*Please*," and my voice breaks completely on the word. "Please, Arylë, I'm *begging* you—stay where you are. Don't come closer. Don't—I can't—if you—"

The light pulses, pulses, *pulses*, matching something like a heartbeat but all wrong, and I can feel it trying to reach for her even from across the room.

"I'll kill you," I finally manage, and the words taste like bile and truth. "Not on purpose. Not because I want to. But this *thing*—it doesn't care about intention. It just—it's always hungry and you're—you're *bright*, Arylë. You always were. And it wants—"

My hand presses harder against my chest, nails digging in through fabric.

"So please. *Please*. Just—go get Morena. Or Elminster. Or—anyone who might know how to help from a *distance*. But don't—"

Don't touch me. Don't try to heal me. Don't do what you always do, what you've *always* done, which is wade directly into danger because you think you can fix it through sheer force of will and wild magic.

Don't make me hurt you.

Don't make me prove that everything Mystra said about me was *right*.

---

*"What the..."*

*It's automatic, I ain't thinking about what's comin' out me mouth, but me eyes are locked on that indigo blue pulsing under your collarbone. Up the side of your neck. Oh... I reach my hand out, I want to reach you, touch you, dear gods, Gale, let me fecking hold you.*

*But you stop me. What is this? This ain't anything I've ever seen before it... it smells Netherese but that don't make any sense. And you're telling me -*

*No*

**NO**

*The hells do you mean you'll kill me. Go get your ma, Elminster. Why the feck aren't they here anyway? How long have you? I step closer. Finally within touchin' distance. And oh gods I can feel it, whatever that light is, it's - It's reachin' for somethin' ain't it?*

*I keep me hands to meself, but I ain't but six inches in front o' you now. Me fingers flexing at me sides, itchin' to - well, gods it's been a long time ain't it been? And whatever this is, whatever is happening, let me help you. I will, you know I will.*

*Of course, there's someone else who I'm sure would be more equipped than me to handle something like this. Yet there ain't a sign o' her around ANYWHERE. That's weird ain't it? I start lookin around your room, this room, the most private space you've got. There should be all sorts of signs of her in here. But there's nothing. Is this how Wizards get reputations for being insane in the top of their towers? I'll be sure ta ask you that one later - there's a much more pressing question running through me head right now.*

"Where in the nine hells is ***MYSTRA***?"
