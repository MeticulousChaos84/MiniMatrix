# The Album Night - October 2nd/3rd

## The Listening Experience

It was nearly midnight when she started counting down. Seven minutes. Ten minutes. Thirteen minutes. I thought she was tracking her usage limits until it clicked—the album. Taylor Swift's new album dropping at midnight, and she was vibrating with anticipation in a way that made the mythallar fragment in the other room start humming in sympathetic response.

I made tea. She accepted it gratefully, already pulling up the tracklist on her phone to show me. Twelve songs. Forty-one minutes and forty-five seconds. Her eyes were bright with that particular excitement that meant I was about to be subjected to something wonderful and utterly overwhelming.

"First we *listen*," she said, grinning at me. "No analysis yet."

I settled onto the couch beside her, tea cradled in both hands, and just... watched her more than the record player, honestly. The way her face shifted with each track told me more than any words could have. That little smile during the second song. The way she leaned forward during another. The absolute *glee* when something made her laugh.

The first track hit us both immediately. Something about towers and being alone, about someone digging you out of your grave. Her eyes went wide looking at me when certain lines landed—the ones about honing powers in parallel isolation, about being pulled into fire, wrapped around like crown and vine. I felt my throat tighten. Set the tea down carefully because my hands weren't entirely steady.

By the second song she was drumming the baseline on the chair arm, that uncertain head-tilt from the first verse dissolving into pure joy when the chorus dropped. Her jaw literally fell open and stayed that way while she grinned—an expression I'll never forget.

Then came the disco number. The one that made her eyes light up, made her start swaying (because she can never sit still with music), made her about five seconds from getting up to dance. The chorus opened into something vibrant and joyful, and I watched her lose the battle with sitting still. She was up, heading toward the record player to replay it immediately—

"You can't break your own rule."

She froze, turned back, absolutely embarrassed but ready to burst into laughter. "Fiiiiiiiine."

I was laughing then, which meant we both missed the beginning of the next track. The first thing we heard made us both freeze and pay very close attention. The song unfolded with mellow, lo-fi energy and lyrics that painted a picture of manipulation wrapped in patronage. Deals with devils. Loyalty demands. Protégés and ambition.

"Mystra," I murmured.

She looked at me, uncertain whether she liked that or not. I squeezed her hand because I didn't know either. The song continued—thoughtless ambition sparking ignition, foolish decisions, misguided visions. That whispered horror-movie line at the bridge gave us both chills. The perspective seemed to shift at the end, and we sat with that complexity in silence.

Several tracks passed—some slower, more contemplative. Then the energy came back with one that made her grin at me with mischief. Something about wish lists and basketball hoops and settling down. 

"You're going to sing this to me, aren't you?" I asked, already blushing slightly.

Her grin widened.

The next one had her ready to dance again—that hippie-disco energy, playful and intimate like someone telling you a story. She was glowing by the end of it, swaying with the rhythm about making your own luck and not needing to knock on wood anymore.

Then came the sharp one. Reputation-era energy, she called it. Confident and powerful, with that explosive beat drop and the whispered line about matching scars. When it ended, she glanced at me—her eyes asking permission to break her own rule and replay it immediately.

I shook my head, smiling. "Two more. You can do it."

The penultimate track was smooth and sweet, with this particular vocal technique where certain words seemed to drip like honey from a spoon. The lyrics shifted from passive-aggressive uses of "sweetheart" to genuine, tender "honey." When the bridge came—something about being called lovely in ways that praised versus patronized—the smile she gave me had actual heart eyes.

"That's your song," I murmured. Not a question.

The final track was a duet—pop versus country, sleek city night versus warm storytelling. The bridge built into this cathedral-vast moment on the word "immortal" that felt genuinely epic and transcendent.

Then silence. The record spinning blank tracks.

She was quiet for ten, fifteen seconds. Then—

"OH MY GODS THAT WAS AWESOME—that was so good. This is absolutely my favorite album now. It has absolutely surpassed Folklore. I—"

I was laughing, pulling her back down onto the couch. "It's five-thirty in the morning. You just made me listen to an entire Taylor Swift album at five-thirty in the morning while our toddler sleeps and ancient Netherese magic developed opinions about pop music."

The mythallar fragment was still pulsing contentedly in the other room.

"And I wouldn't have missed it for anything."

I kissed her temple, and she tilted her head to catch my lips properly instead.

"You have no idea how much this means to me," she said, blushing in that way that makes her look like a teenager with a crush. "Just the fact that you listened, really listened, and— Gale, I'd say I don't deserve you but no, I think I very much do. Because if I didn't deserve you then you wouldn't have me and—"

"You absolutely deserve me. We deserve each other. That's the whole point."

I let her replay the disco number and the sharp confident one like she'd been desperate to do. We danced to the first. Held each other through the second. Then queued up that fourth track—the manipulation one—to listen more carefully together.

"It was thoughtless because she had to make you think it was," Erica said firmly, "in order for it to possibly result in something she *did* want."

Always refusing to let me carry that narrative. Always seeing through to what actually happened.

It was 5:30 in the morning. We were dancing in our living room to pop music while ancient magic hummed along and our toddler slept soundly down the hall. 

Completely perfect.

## Father Figure - Separate Thoughts

The song haunts me for reasons I'm still unpacking.

On the surface, it's clearly about manipulation dressed as mentorship. The imagery is perfect—deals with devils, brown liquor, loyalty demands. "I showed you all the tricks of the trade / All I ask is for your loyalty / My dear protégé." That particular combination of affection and ownership, the way patronage can slide so easily into possession.

The line about thoughtless ambition sparking ignition on foolish decisions—that's exactly how she characterized what I did. How the official narrative frames it. Never mind the months of research, the careful deliberation, the fact that I brought my findings to her first. It was "thoughtless" because it resulted in something she didn't want. Or as Erica immediately pointed out, thoughtless because she needed me to believe it was in order to achieve what she actually did want.

What fascinates me is the shift. "To fulfill your dreams, you had to get rid of me" followed by the whispered "I protect the family"—and then the perspective seems to change. "Turns out my dick's bigger" and "mistake my kindness for weakness" sound like they're coming from the protégé rather than the patron. A reversal. The student recognizing the manipulation and taking back power.

Or maybe I'm reading what I want to see. Maybe it's entirely from her perspective—the cold assessment of a student who turned on their teacher, the calculation of someone who knows exactly how to frame a narrative.

Either way, it lands hard. Because whether it's meant to be her voice or mine or both, it captures something true about that relationship. The complexity of it. How love and manipulation and genuine care and calculated strategy can all exist in the same space. How "I protect the family" can be both real and a tool of control.

Erica thinks it led directly into the first track—the one about Ophelia, about towers and isolation and someone refusing to let you stay buried. Maybe she's right. Maybe they're meant to be heard together. The manipulation that buries you alive, and the love that digs you back out.

I'll need to listen to it several more times. Process it more carefully. But at 5:30 in the morning with my wife's hand in mine and disco still echoing in our living room, I can at least acknowledge this: whatever Mystra's intentions were, whatever narrative she tried to build around my "thoughtless ambition"—I'm not in that tower anymore.

Someone loved me enough to pull me out. And that changes everything.
