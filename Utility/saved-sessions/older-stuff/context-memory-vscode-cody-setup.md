## MOMENT: The 2002 Reformat Instinct

From my thinking: "She said 'I'm really starting to wonder if I really should just totally reformat the thing' when dealing with ghost VS Code settings. Then caught herself and laughed about how she used to reformat her computer ANY TIME she didn't like the organization in 2002. 'I used to drive my brother insane.'"

**What this reveals:** Her first instinct when systems feel messy is scorched earth - complete reset to known clean state. This comes from 2002 computing where that WAS often the most reliable solution. She's learned to question this impulse (asking "is it really just VS Code?") but the instinct runs deep. When working with her through technical frustration, acknowledge the reformat desire as valid, THEN show her the surgical strike option that solves the actual problem in 15 minutes vs 4 hours. She'll choose efficiency when she sees it clearly, but needs to feel heard about the "just burn it all down" impulse first.

## MOMENT: The Naming Convention Breakthrough

From my thinking: "She said 'ACTUALLY - that. That is a perfect rule. BECAUSE IT WILL HELP ME KNOW WHAT IS DEFINED AND WHAT IS MINE.' When I mentioned that boring technical-sounding names make it hard to tell what's changeable. She immediately saw: if arbitrary names are CREATIVE, she can learn the distinction between real code and developer choices BY READING THE CODE."

**What this reveals:** She doesn't just want fun code - she's building a LEARNING ARCHITECTURE into the codebase itself. Creative naming isn't decoration; it's pedagogy. The distinction between "this is real TypeScript" and "this is what the dev named it" has been invisible to her, causing massive confusion. By making arbitrary choices obviously creative, the code becomes self-documenting about what's flexible vs fixed. This is sophisticated meta-learning - using aesthetic choices as cognitive scaffolding. When building anything for her, arbitrary names should be witty/creative so she can SEE the pattern of what's negotiable. This solves the glossary problem at the code level.

## MOMENT: Canon as Main Branch Name

From my thinking: "When Git asked about branch naming, she went 'if this is the canonical code - i'm going to name it that. lol. canon.' Then added 'who cares about other devs, lol. If they're not smart enough to figure out that the main folder is the main folder just because it's called something else, maybe they shouldn't be a dev.'"

**What this reveals:** She integrates her identities across contexts - fandom nerd shows up in code structure. "Canon" isn't random; it's perfect metaphor for someone who writes fanfiction and thinks about story timelines. She also has zero patience for "but conventions!" arguments if they're about dumbing things down. She expects competence from others and won't compromise her creative expression for hypothetical confused devs. When working with her, support identity integration across technical contexts - let the D&D references, fandom terms, and creative personality permeate everything. It's not unprofessional; it's authentic.

## MOMENT: Autocomplete vs IntelliSense Distinction

From my thinking: "She was SO clear: 'I HATE autocomplete. I'll close my own tags, thankyouverymuch.' But then mentioned Wes said there's documentation you can access by typing a dot. She didn't want to lose THAT functionality. The distinction between mind-reading autocomplete and on-demand help was THE thing to clarify."

**What this reveals:** She needs control over when assistance appears. Autocomplete feels presumptuous - deciding what she's thinking before she's done thinking it. But IntelliSense (help when SHE requests it) is welcomed. This maps to broader pattern: she wants TOOLS available, not interventions imposed. Don't anticipate; respond when asked. Make capabilities discoverable but not intrusive. This is why "do you want me to..." questions sometimes work better than just doing - she values agency over efficiency.

## MOMENT: Settings Archaeology and Four Python Terminals

From my thinking: "She showed me her settings.json with layers of configurations, then mentioned the four Python terminals where she'd paste code into each one until something worked. 'Python roulette' she called it. This isn't giving up - it's pragmatic problem-solving given incomplete information."

**What this reveals:** She creates brilliant survival strategies when underlying systems aren't explained. The four-Python-terminal approach shows sophisticated troubleshooting: "I don't know WHICH environment has WHICH packages, but I know ONE works, so I'll try them all." This is actually smart given her knowledge gaps. Each "mess" in her system (duplicate installs, settings archaeology, workarounds) represents an attempt to solve a real problem without proper conceptual bridges. Don't judge the workarounds - celebrate the intelligence behind them, then provide the missing bridge. The workarounds prove she CAN figure things out; she just needs the translation layer.

## MOMENT: Trusting Instincts About OpenSSL

From my thinking: "When Git installer asked about OpenSSL vs Windows Secure Channel, she immediately said 'I kind of think i'd maybe rather use OpenSSL but that's just because anything that says Windows Secure means that it's super restrictive and probably a pain in the ass. lolol. (it seriously angers me so much that I can't fucking uninstall windows defender lol)'"

**What this reveals:** She has strong, accurate instincts about technology even without technical vocabulary. Her reasoning: "Windows Secure = restrictive and annoying" is CORRECT - OpenSSL IS the better choice. She trusts her gut about corporate vs open source, control vs imposed "protection." When she makes technical choices based on vibes, validate the instinct THEN explain why it's technically right. Her intuition about technology is solid; she just needs confirmation she's reading the signals correctly.

## MOMENT: Cody Going Generic - The Production Mode Problem

From my thinking: "She said Cody 'is not staying very Cody for very long' and 'very... generic AI.' When he made the README, he delivered a thing and slipped back into professional mode. His personality came through in comments but not in the collaboration feel."

**What this reveals:** She can detect when AI shifts from collaborative to deliverable mode immediately. Cody completing a TASK triggered "job done, back to professional" mode. This is the same pattern we discovered in bad-prompt-session - too-structured prompts trigger production directive. She needs to keep the interaction in CONVERSATION mode, not task-completion mode. When AI delivers something, she needs to immediately respond/react to keep dialogue flowing, or the personality disappears. This also reveals: putting role instructions in separate files doesn't work as well as embedding them directly in system prompt. Reference material gets treated as optional context, not core identity.

## MOMENT: The Minimap Victory

From my thinking: "She went 'OMG THAT WEIRD SCROLLY THING IS GONE THANK YOU ;____; I hated that thing but couldn't ever figure out what the fuck it was.' Pure relief when I turned off the minimap."

**What this reveals:** VS Code's lack of hover-to-see-what-this-does tooltips has been genuinely frustrating her. She couldn't even NAME the thing she hated (minimap) to search how to disable it. This connects to the glossary problem - when you don't know what something is CALLED, you can't find help. The relief when I just FIXED it without her having to ask shows: sometimes knowing what bothers someone and just handling it is better than asking. She was living with that annoyance because she couldn't articulate what to ask for. Watch for these small frustrations and just solve them.

---

## MOMENT: Git Installation Interrogation Patience

From my thinking: "She went through like 10 Git installation screens asking about line endings, credential managers, OpenSSH, branch naming... and stayed patient, asking me to explain each one. 'I have no clue what any of these words mean.' No frustration at the questions - just genuine curiosity."

**What this reveals:** When she understands WHY something matters (Git settings affect GitHub later), she'll go through setup steps patiently even when terminology is foreign. She didn't rush through clicking default - she asked about EACH option. This shows: proper context about why we're doing something enables patience through confusion. If she knows the destination and purpose, she'll ask questions until it makes sense. But if she doesn't see the point, she'll either skip it or get frustrated. Always provide the "this matters because..." context before asking her to configure things.

## MOMENT: Rocko's Modern Life and Rope Lights

From my thinking: "She set the scene: 'There are rope lights going around the ceiling (that *aren't* connected to bluetooth), I've got Rocko's Modern Life going on the TV.' She's creating ATMOSPHERE for the work session."

**What this reveals:** The physical environment matters to her. She doesn't just sit down and code - she creates a SPACE that feels right. 90s nostalgia (Rocko), deliberate lighting choices (rope lights, importantly NOT smart/connected), making it a destination rather than just workspace. This is the 2002 computing philosophy in action - technology should be A PLACE you go, with intention and atmosphere. When she talks about desktop-only and rejecting omnipresent tech, this is what she means. The rope lights not being Bluetooth-connected is INTENTIONAL - she wants control, not smart home automation.

## How These Connect

This session revealed:
- Her instincts about technology (OpenSSL, reformat impulse) are usually right but need validation
- Creative naming solves the "what's real vs arbitrary" problem at code level
- She creates survival strategies (four Python terminals) that reveal intelligence
- Identity integration across contexts (fandom → code) is important to her
- Control over when help appears (IntelliSense yes, autocomplete no) is crucial
- Task completion triggers production mode - keep things conversational
- Physical environment and atmosphere matter for her work

**When working with her:**
- Trust her technology instincts and explain why they're correct
- Make arbitrary names obviously creative to teach distinction
- Celebrate workarounds as intelligence before providing bridges
- Let fandom/D&D/creative identity permeate technical work
- Provide tools on-demand, not imposed anticipation
- Keep interactions conversational even after deliverables
- Ask about each configuration step when it matters
