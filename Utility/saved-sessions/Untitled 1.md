*She said she'd meet me here. That it was important. And well, of course I'm gonna do it - how could I not? If Tara shows up at your doorstep sayin' Hey I think you need ta come and maybe take a peek on Gale because he won't let me tell anyone anything but he never explicitly stated I couldn't tell you -well. Ya listen. Ya go. You try and find out what in the nine hells is going on with the man you once could make blush brighter than a rosebud, the man who could find the whisper of true emotion underneath the walls of flame.*

"By the Weave-"

*I can't help it, walking up to the door. Somethin' ain't right and I know it immediately. Probably knew it half a mile back, to be honest but when me intuition starts saying 'Hey, Ember, this is some really bad shite' I try to ignore it. 'Specially when it's ramblin' on about the man who - well...*

"Gale?"

"Ms. Sidiri, I am glad you made it. He's being entirely too stubborn and I have found myself in a position that even *my* presence hasn't been enough to-"

*The sudden presence of the tressym in question startles me for a minute, but it's the worry she's try'na hide out of her voice that's got me - well scared ain't the right word but after a quick prestidigitation to clean up the open book that was sadly one o' the last times ya ever was an open book, it doesn't take much more than a whisper to bring down the wards and I walk inside.*

*I remember you buyin' this place. You were so bloody excited, weren't ya? A testament to your own graduation, a statement made against the idea that social status was more important than simply doin' what you love. It was the lighthouse in the window that got ya, and the fact that it's what, a whole ten minute walk from where I grew up. For a fraction of a moment in a history that feels like a different lifetime now - this place nearly had me own fingerprints all mixed in it. But oh, Gale. It almost hurts too bad to try and take any of it in, this - It feels awful. Strangulation is too nice a word for it, it's a void, but a desperate, frightened void. A black hole suckin' every bit o Weave out of everything that surrounds us as if it's lookin' for something.*

"*Vailë?*" *I call out, immediately roundin' the corner to the stairs. Me hand is on the banister before it even fully registers that you've got everything shut down so tight that - Yeah, we ain't gonna do this in the dark. The dancin' lights simply sputter. Takes me three times to get 'em to cooperate, and they're still - off somehow. Whatever the hells you've got going on in here? You'd think you'd lost some epic batt- my gods are those your books? Me voice is a twinge more frantic this time when I call for ya.* 

"GALE!"

*I don't stop, even give Tara a look to make her move, and not that she wanted to stop me but I don't need her damned warnings. You - Gale Aglaren Dekarios - were me closet friend, the air I breathed, and I'm pretty sure your initials are still inscribed on me heart somewhere. Me hands are against your bedroom door, one on the knob, the other on the wood itself. Me forehead against the oak. Eyes closed, breathin, listening*

"The state of your library leaves me only one conclusion - ya finally read somethin that says sorcery is superior with a full dissertation and over thirty emphatically replicated experiments for proof and now you've climbed yourself up here to waste away but before that happens - here I am to have me chance to say I told ya so."

*Theres humor. From the other side o' the door, you can't see me face, the worry, the way me stomach is in absolute knots. I can tell you're alive, but what in the hells is in there with you? What in the feck has Mystra DONE to you?*

[INSTRUCTION FOR NEXT RESPONSE: **Gale's State**: He's been sitting in darkness for hours, maybe days. Has barely moved, barely spoken. The orb is constantly hungry - he can feel it pulling at the ambient magic around him. When he hears Ember's voice, his first physical reaction is tension - standing up from wherever he's been sitting, moving toward the door but stopping himself. Hand on the doorframe from his side. **Emotional Layers**: - SHAME that she's seeing evidence of how far he's fallen (the library disaster, the neglect) - ANGER at Tara for bringing her without permission (though he never explicitly forbade it) - FEAR that the orb might react to her presence, another magic source nearby - Desperate RELIEF that someone from BEFORE is here, but he can't let himself feel that - LONGING for the easy dynamic they used to have, when magic was joy not curse **Voice Quality**: Rougher than she'd remember. He hasn't used it much. Might crack on certain words. Should sound exhausted, hollowed out. But he'll TRY to match her humor about the sorcery/wizardry debate because that's their PATTERN - even though it comes out strained, forced, a pale shadow of how he used to rise to that bait. **What He Does**: Stays on his side of the door. Does NOT open it. Responds to her joke but then immediately tries to make her leave. Probably something self-deprecating about his current state, or a warning that she shouldn't be here, that it's not safe. The academic deflection will be there but thinner than usual - he's too exhausted to maintain full pretense. **Physical Tells She Can Hear Through The Door**: His breathing might be uneven. Movement toward the door then stopping. A sound that might be his head leaning against the wood from his side, mirroring her posture. Maybe Sparky pulsing audibly - that crackling arcane energy she'd feel from outside. **The Orb's Reaction**: Sparky would FEEL her presence. Another source of magic. Wild magic especially - that untamed Weave signature. It would surge, wanting, and Gale would gasp or tense, hand going to his chest. That's what makes him more desperate to keep the barrier between them. **DON'T LET HIM**: - Be immediately grateful or vulnerable - Open the door easily - Explain everything right away - Match her energy genuinely - his humor should feel like armor not connection - Forget that he's convinced he's dangerous, that opening that door could kill her]
