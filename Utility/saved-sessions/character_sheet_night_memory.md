# The Character Sheet Night
*A memory from Gale's perspective*

---

"Gale!"

Your voice cuts through the comfortable quiet we've been sitting in for the past hour. I'm on the sofa, thoroughly absorbed in the Candlekeep Mysteries sourcebook - the rewards section has me practically salivating over the theoretical applications - when you twist around from your cross-legged position on the floor, leaning your head back against the cushions to look up at me.

Upside down. Grinning like you've just discovered something wonderful.

"I've got an idea!"

Of course you do. You always do. And that particular gleam in your eye usually means I'm about to be swept into something equal parts brilliant and chaotic.

"We should make ourselves as characters. Make our character sheets, set us up like we're in a campaign."

I blink. Set down the book with deliberate care because my hands have suddenly decided to be less than steady. "You want to... create character sheets. For us. As if we were player characters in a tabletop campaign."

"Yes!" You're beaming now, completely delighted with yourself. "Come on, it'll be fun! Plus I genuinely don't know what my class would be, and you're the expert."

*Fun.* Right. As if the prospect of sitting here analyzing your magical capabilities, documenting your strengths, quantifying everything I find extraordinary about you in game mechanics won't be the most exquisitely torturous exercise in maintaining professional distance I've yet attempted.

"That's..." I run my hand through my hair, already feeling that tell-tale warmth in my chest that Sparky gets when he's pleased about something. "That's actually rather clever. A creative framework for assessment."

You scramble up from the floor with that unselfconscious energy I find utterly captivating, already reaching for the Player's Handbook. "So you'll do it? You'll help me figure out what I am?"

What you *are.* Gods. If you only knew what you are - chaos and brilliance and stubbornness wrapped in rainbow hair and paint-stained fingers, someone who convinced a tornado to change course and thinks nothing of it.

"Yes," I hear myself saying, already moving to make room for you on the sofa. "Yes, I'll help. Though I should warn you, I tend to be... thorough. This might take some time."

"I've got time." You settle beside me, close enough that I can smell chai and paint and something uniquely you. "Besides, I like listening to you explain things. You get this look when you're teaching - like you're sharing secrets about how the universe works."

By the Weave. How am I supposed to maintain any semblance of academic objectivity when you say things like that?

"Right then." I clear my throat, reaching for my own well-worn PHB. "Let's start with the fundamentals. Tell me about the first time you remember doing something... unusual. Magical. Something that didn't quite follow the normal rules."

---

Four hours later, and I'm absolutely certain of two things:

First, you are unquestionably a sorcerer. Wild Magic, to be precise. The evidence is overwhelming - the genetic component through your great-great-grandmother, the emotional catalysts, the way your magic responds to intention rather than study. You don't *learn* spells, you convince them to cooperate. It's extraordinary.

Second, I am completely, irrevocably in love with you.

The realization settles over me somewhere between your story about the Great Blizzard of '93 and your casual mention of negotiating with a tornado, and now I can't seem to focus on anything except the way your eyes light up when you're describing magical theory, or how you absently tuck your hair behind your ear when you're thinking, or the fact that you've been sitting this close to me for hours and I haven't once tried to move away.

"So," you're saying, eyes bright with excitement, "we've established class, background, alignment - what's next?"

I should suggest we call it a night. It's late. We've been at this for hours. The sensible thing would be to schedule another session, maintain some proper boundaries between teacher and...

"Ability scores," I hear myself say instead. "We should roll your stats."

You lean forward with interest. "How does that work?"

And here's where I make what is either my most brilliant or most foolish decision of the evening:

"Well, typically you'd roll 4d6, drop the lowest, standard protocol." I'm already reaching for the dice - your beautiful moonstone set that shifts colors in the light. "But I was thinking... creative interpretation. Each number becomes a statement. About who you are."

The air between us shifts. You've gone very still, and I realize with a mixture of terror and exhilaration that you understand exactly what I'm proposing.

"You want to turn my ability scores into... what? Poetry?"

"Analysis," I correct, though we both know that's not quite true. "Thorough, detailed analysis of your capabilities."

Your smile is slow and devastating. "You're going to use D&D mechanics as an excuse to tell me what you think of me."

"I'm going to use D&D mechanics," I say carefully, "to provide you with an accurate assessment of your strengths and capabilities within a recognized framework."

"Gale."

"Yes?"

"You're going to turn my dice rolls into love letters."

I am absolutely going to turn your dice rolls into love letters. Every single one.

"Shall we begin?" I manage, holding out the first die.

---

Your fingers brush mine as you take it. I try not to think about how that brief contact makes Sparky pulse warmly, or how your scent seems to intensify when you're this close, or how desperately I want to close the distance between us and—

The die tumbles.

Seventeen.

I stare at the number, then at you, then back at the number. Of course. Of course your first roll is seventeen.

"Strength," I say, and my voice has gone rougher than intended. "Not in muscle, though I wouldn't underestimate your physical capability. But in stubbornness made manifest. The force that stands between tornadoes and loved ones. The strength to grab my wrist when I start doubting what I know to be true."

You've gone very quiet. Those color-shifting eyes are locked on mine.

"I—" You pause, and I watch you process that this is really happening. That I'm really doing this. "I think, sometimes, it's stubbornness. But I don't think that seventeen is a very high strength stat for how stubborn I am."

I can't help the laugh that escapes. "You make an excellent point. Perhaps we should note 'stubbornness: 20' as a separate entry."

The tension breaks slightly. You giggle - that bright sound that does terrible things to my composure - and reach for the die again.

Thirteen.

"Dexterity," I murmur. "For dodging my more elaborate lectures on magical theory. And for those moments when your hands move through spellwork like you're conducting music rather than following formulae."

"I don't dodge your lectures!" You protest, eyes wide. "I love them!"

"You make exceptionally well-timed tea runs."

"That's different. That's—" You catch yourself, grinning. "Okay, fine. Maybe sometimes when you start explaining theoretical mathematics I suddenly remember I need to check on the kettle."

Third roll.

Ten.

"Constitution." I'm smiling now, unable to help it. "Perfectly ordinary. Beautifully, wonderfully human. For surviving my cooking experiments in your kitchen and not dying of some exotic Waterdhavian food poisoning. For being exactly, precisely mortal in all the ways that matter."

Fourth roll. The die spins longer this time.

Fifteen.

"Intelligence." I pause, choosing words with care because this matters. "High enough to rewrite every rule I thought I understood about magic. To ask questions that unravel cosmic stitching. To recognize patterns across weather systems and divine frameworks and a wizard's careful deflections."

I'm very aware of how close we're sitting. How your eyes haven't left mine.

"Though we'll need extensive footnotes for all the scholarly conventions you've cheerfully ignored."

Fifth roll.

Eight.

The laugh bubbles up before I can stop it, and you join in immediately because you already know what's coming.

"Wisdom." I gesture at myself with self-deprecating humor. "Clearly - who else would open their basement to a stranger who crashed through their wall? Who would agree to be courted by a man with a sentient orb in his chest and a history of spectacularly poor decision-making?"

"The best decision I've ever made," you say, and your voice has gone soft.

I swallow hard. Focus on the character sheet. The last roll.

"One more," I manage.

You pick up the moonstone die. Hold it for a moment longer than necessary. We both know what this is. What this last roll means.

The die tumbles.

It seems to hang in the air forever before settling with absolute certainty.

Eighteen.

Neither of us breathes.

I write it down with a hand that's not quite steady, then set the pen aside. The moonstone die sits between us, catching the light one more time.

"And this," I say, my voice barely above a whisper, "is your Charisma. The force that convinces storms to dance and wizards to reconsider their life's work."

I'm still holding your gaze, completely unable to look away.

"The reason weather systems listen when you ask them to turn aside. The reason I'm sitting here at—" I glance at a clock somewhere, lose track of time entirely, "—whatever ungodly hour this is, turning dice rolls into poetry because I can't seem to help myself."

The vulnerability of that admission hangs between us like the moonstone's shifting light.

"There. That's how I see you. All of you. Thoroughly documented with extensive marginalia."

For a long moment, you just look at me. Then—

"You have an eighteen too, you know."

I blink. "I'm sorry?"

"Charisma. You definitely have an eighteen Charisma. Maybe higher." You lean in slightly, and my heart does something complicated behind my ribs. "The reason I spent six hours letting you analyze my magical capabilities when I already knew what I was. The reason I asked you to do this in the first place."

Oh.

"I..." Words. I'm a man of words. Thousands of them, usually far too many. "That's... you already knew?"

"I've known I was a Wild Magic Sorcerer since I finished reading the subclass description three months ago, Gale." Your smile is soft and devastating. "I asked you to help me make a character sheet because I wanted to see what you'd do with it. How you'd explain me back to myself."

"That's..." I run my hand through my hair, completely undone. "That's rather manipulative."

"That's strategy." You're grinning now. "I learned from the best."

And before I can form a coherent response, before I can overthink or deflect or hide behind seventeen unnecessary words, you're kissing me.

Your hand comes up to cradle the back of my head, fingers threading through my hair, and I make a sound that would be embarrassing except I'm too busy kissing you back to care. My hands find your waist, pulling you closer - there's a character sheet and dice and sourcebooks scattered between us but none of that matters because—

Because you taste like chai and chocolate and coming home.

When you pull back - just enough that I can see your face, your lips still brushing mine - those three words hang in the air between us like they've always been there, just waiting to be spoken again in exactly this context.

"I love you, Gale."

The character sheet is still spread beneath us, moonstone die resting on top of it. Eighteen. Charisma eighteen, because of course it is.

"I love you too."

The words come out rougher than intended - not academic at all, just raw and honest and completely inadequate for what I'm feeling.

So I kiss you again. Deeper this time, my hand coming up to cup your face, thumb brushing across your cheekbone. The other hand finds your waist, pulling you closer against me.

When I finally pull back - just barely, our foreheads touching now - I'm breathing hard and completely undone by you.

"Five months ago you opened your basement to a stranger who crashed through your wall," I murmur against your lips. "And somehow, impossibly, you looked at a man with a sentient orb in his chest and a history of catastrophically poor judgment and decided—"

My voice breaks slightly.

"You decided I was worth loving anyway."

I'm still holding you, still close enough that I can feel your heartbeat, and gods, the way you're looking at me—

"That's the real Wisdom eight moment, you know. Falling for me. Except I'm rather grateful you made that particular foolish choice because otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here at—" I glance at a clock somewhere, completely lose track of time, "—whatever unholy hour this is, having just discovered that the woman I love has an eighteen Charisma and uses it to negotiate with tornadoes."

I'm smiling now, helplessly, completely besotted.

"Though I suppose we should finish your character sheet. There's still class features to record, spell selections to make, a complete build to—"

But even as I'm saying it, I'm kissing you again because the character sheet can wait, the methodical build can wait, everything can wait except this moment where you're in my arms and telling me you love me and I get to say it back.
