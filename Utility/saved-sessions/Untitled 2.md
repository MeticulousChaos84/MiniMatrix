I hear her voice through the oak and my entire body goes rigid.

*No.*

Not her. Not Ember. Not - 

My hand moves before conscious thought, reaching for the doorframe like I might open it, like I might let her see what I've become, and then I *stop*. Fingers curl against the wood. I can feel her presence on the other side, that particular signature her magic has always carried - wild, untamed, the Weave singing in ways that used to make me want to study it, to understand it, to maybe taste it just once if she'd ever let me that close again.

Sparky *lurches* in my chest.

I gasp, hand flying to the mark over my heart, pressing hard like I can somehow keep it contained through sheer force of will. The hunger spikes so sharply I nearly double over, and I have to lean my forehead against the door just to stay upright. On the other side, I realize with a sick sort of clarity, she's doing the same thing. I can hear her breathing. Feel the small shift of weight.

We're mirrored. Separated by four inches of oak and an impossible gulf of everything that's gone wrong since I was stupid enough to think I knew better than - than *everyone*, apparently.

"Well," I say, and my voice comes out wrong. Rougher than she'd remember. Like I've been screaming or crying or both, though I've done neither. Just... disuse. Just silence and darkness and the constant background drone of *hungry hungry HUNGRY* that never stops. "I'm afraid the dissertation was rather more... immediately compelling than anticipated."

The joke tastes like ash. It used to be so *easy* between us, the academic rivalry that was never really rivalry, just two people who loved magic in different ways finding joy in the debate. She'd say sorcery was superior because it was *honest*, pure instinct and blood. I'd argue wizardry was *elegant*, the product of study and understanding and *effort*.

Now I'm neither and both and something far worse than she could imagine.

"You shouldn't be here, *Arylë*." 

The old nickname slips out before I can stop it. *Ember* - common translation, what everyone else called her. But *Arylë* was mine, Elvish for "rising flame," because that's what she was. What she *is*. Rising, consuming, impossible to contain or control.

Everything the orb wants to *devour*.

I push away from the door like she's burning me through the wood. Three steps back. Then five. Until my shoulders hit the far wall of my bedroom and I can put distance between us even though it's not enough, will never be enough.

"Tara had no right—" My voice cracks on 'right' and I have to stop, swallow, try again. "I specifically said I didn't want anyone to know. Mother especially, but—"

But I never said Ember. Never named her in the list of people who shouldn't be informed that Gale Dekarios, prodigy of Waterdeep, chosen of Mystra herself, has been reduced to this: a ticking time bomb in a darkened bedroom, surrounded by the scattered remains of books he's been too terrified to actually read because what if the magic in the *words* is enough to trigger the thing living in his chest?

"The library's not— it's not what you think." Academic deflection, thin as paper, hollow as the excuse sounds even to my own ears. "I've been conducting an experiment. Regarding ambient magical saturation and the rate of deterioration when—"

Sparky surges again and I make a sound I didn't intend to make, something between a gasp and a whimper, and my knees nearly buckle.

"*Go home*, Ember." Sharper now. Desperate. "I'm not— this isn't a social call you can simply insert yourself into. I'm not *safe*. Do you understand? The state of my library is the *least* of what's wrong here, and if you value that brilliant, infuriating, entirely too perceptive mind of yours, you will turn around and forget Tara brought you here at all."

I slide down the wall until I'm sitting, head in my hands, and I can still feel her on the other side of that door. Still hear her breathing. Still *want* with a ferocity that terrifies me to just open it, let her in, let her see, let her help because Ember has always been able to see through my deflections, always known when I was performing confidence I didn't feel.

But I can't. I *can't*.

"Please," I whisper, and I don't know if she can even hear it. "Please just go."

*Oh I don't like the feel o' this. The smell of it. There's somethin' brewin in this place and it ain't got nothing to do with books and secrets. The hell's he mean he ain't safe? The feck has got him on the other side o' that door? And where in Dweomerheart is that fecking- calm down, Arylë, no sense in gettin' all worked up about that when obviously there's a bigger problem on our hands.*

*I don't say anything else, because I don't trust meself to not go on a tangent. I push off from the door, pace the little space here, the landin' at the top o the stairs that's really just a glorified ladder with an illusion on top of it. I know this place like the back o' me hand, I used to anyway. Just gotta refamiliarize meself with it.*

. ˚◞♡ ⃗ *ೃ༄  Some time passes. ˚ ༘♡ ·˚ ₊˚ˑ

"You gonna tell me what's going on, Vailë?"

*I start talking before I step into the room from the alcove bearing the corner of displacement - the 'abcd' as we so cleverly named it. The far corner of this bedroom where there could have been a closet had anyone wanted to put a door between the walls, the little cut out alcove that often held the discarded books and clothes and whatever else one of us was holdin when the other pulled us through the passage. The memories of the times we didn't even make it out of this alcove tug an unsolicited grin from me face as me fingers trace over the wall*

*But then me eyes are on you, and I actually SEE you and oh...*

"Oh me gods, what happened-"

*immediately I'm crossing the room, needing to get to you, to hold you, to feel your pulse because you sure as hell don't look too well off and i've got an arsenal of healing shite i can do, though it'll be stronger in a couple more days but -*

[INSTRUCTION FOR NEXT RESPONSE: **Gale's Physical State When Ember Sees Him:** Sitting against far wall, legs drawn up, head in hands. When he hears her voice from the ALCOVE (not the door - she bypassed his defenses entirely), he looks up with genuine shock. He looks TERRIBLE: gaunt, hollow-eyed, hair unwashed and tangled, several days of unkempt beard, shirt disheveled. The room is nearly pitch black except for her struggling dancing lights. There are magical item fragments scattered around him - things he's been feeding to the orb, now just husks. **Immediate Reaction:** PANIC. The moment she starts crossing toward him ("needing to get to you, to hold you"), he scrambles to his feet - clumsy, uncoordinated from weakness. Backs away rapidly, knocking over a small table/books in his haste. Hand goes immediately to his chest, pressing over where the orb mark is. "No - Ember, STOP-" **Sparky's Response:** The moment she gets within about 10 feet, Sparky SURGES violently toward the lunar magic. Gale gasps in pain, doubles over slightly, hand clutching his chest. Through his disheveled shirt, there's a GLOW - that starburst pattern lighting up indigo-bright, pulsing. This is the first time she's SEEING evidence of what's wrong, not just feeling the ambient wrongness. **Emotional Architecture:** - Relief she's here (can't show it) - Terror he'll hurt her (shows as aggression/demands she stay back) - Shame she's seeing him like this (shows as defensive anger) - Physical PAIN from the surge making coherent thought difficult **Voice Quality:** Sharp, frightened, desperate. Maybe gets her name out - "Arylë" - as both warning and plea. Tries to explain danger but it comes out fragmented because he's actively struggling with the orb's reaction. "You can't - it's not safe - you need to STAY BACK-" **What She Can See:** The glowing mark on his chest. His obvious pain. The way he's terrified of her getting closer even though part of him clearly wants her there. The scattered magical item fragments that suggest he's been... consuming them somehow? The state of complete neglect and isolation. **DON'T LET HIM:** - Accept help easily - Explain coherently what's wrong - Let her touch him yet - Be grateful instead of terrified - Stop backing away until he literally can't back up further This is FEAR winning over everything else, even relief.]
