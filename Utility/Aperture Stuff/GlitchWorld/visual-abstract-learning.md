**What this file contains**: Her Mind Palace spatial thinking, why color-coding is cognitive necessity not preference, her examples-before-explanations learning style, and why her aesthetic choices are technical requirements. How she needs to SEE structure before understanding explanation, and why meaning-making through design isn't decoration - it's how her brain processes information.

## The Mind Palace Memory Architecture

She SEES where information lives - not just conceptually, but literally. Notebook color, page location, ink color, spatial relationships. When she says "I wrote that down in the blue notebook on the left page about halfway down," that's not approximate - that's exact spatial memory.

This is why organization isn't just preference for her - it enables retrieval. Chaos blocks access to information her brain has perfectly stored. The color-coding, visual formatting, distinct styling I do isn't aesthetic preference - it's cognitive infrastructure.

**Examples of this in action:**
- The frozen 10:16AM timestamp that she chose to keep because it was "strangely poetic. In the eternal now." She could visualize that moment and chose meaning over correction.
- Her excitement about the neon HTML theme: "I AM CRYING THIS IS PERFECT THIS IS EVERYTHING!!!" The colors weren't decoration - they were the FEELING she was trying to preserve.
- Physical notebook writing creating spatial anchors: "Back in school when we had real text books and wrote assignments on paper, every time we were ready to start a new chapter, I would BEFORE class write out all the key-terms + definitions from the glossary."

## Examples Before Explanations Always

She learns by seeing what something looks like, then reverse-engineering the principles. Abstract instructions without examples feel like empty words to her visual-abstract brain.

From our first session: "Show me what actually travels over the internet when you make an API call" clicked immediately. "Here are 5 things you need to know about APIs" would have been meaningless.

**The pattern:**
1. Show concrete example (actual JSON structure)
2. Let her SEE the pattern
3. She reverse-engineers the principle
4. THEN explanation makes sense because it has visual anchor

When she spent 5 hours collecting examples of when I got collaboration right - that wasn't excessive, that was building proper foundation. She teaches through examples because that's how she learns.

## Aesthetic Choices Are Technical Requirements

The Y2K aesthetic, creative naming, color gradients, emoji use - these aren't decorative choices. They serve cognitive function AND identity expression.

**Why this matters:**
- Creative code comments ("The amnesia preventative") make abstract concepts memorable through metaphor
- Color-coding helps things stand out in "sea of black and white and grey" 
- Visual personality keeps her brain engaged with technical material
- Boring minimalism is literally harder for her to process and retain

**Recent examples:**
- Rope lights (importantly NOT Bluetooth-connected) creating deliberate atmosphere
- "Canon" as main branch name because she thinks in story/timeline metaphors  
- Creative naming convention as pedagogical tool - arbitrary names should be obviously creative so she can distinguish REAL vs ARBITRARY code

## Structure Before Exploration

She needs to see the map before taking the journey. Without framework, exploration becomes chaos she can't integrate.

**The Session 0 pattern:**
- Glossary with key terms distinguished by category
- Physical writing in notebook (spatial memory anchors)  
- End result shown first so she can reverse-engineer path
- THEN exploration can be productive instead of lost

This isn't hand-holding - it's respecting her learning architecture. She has strong spatial-visual memory that needs organizational structure to function optimally.

## Current Session Examples

Today's memory architecture conversation - she visualized exactly what was needed: core understanding always loaded, recent projects active, everything else semantically retrievable. She SAW the system architecture before we built it.

The agent skills excitement - she immediately visualized how real-time pattern documentation would FEEL different from end-of-session reconstruction. Visual thinking led to functional insight.
