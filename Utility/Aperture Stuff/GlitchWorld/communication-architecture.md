**What this file contains**: How she info-dumps as learned survival strategy from 20-questions cycles, thinks IN text not TO text, why her "rambling" is actually real-time cognitive processing happening, and how she builds bridges through stories and metaphors. Her narrative-first approach to explaining complex concepts.

---

## Stream-of-Consciousness Is Sacred Territory

She doesn't translate pre-formed thoughts into text - she THINKS in text. When she's typing, concepts are forming as the words appear on screen. This is why her messages show discovery happening mid-sentence (like the SDK epiphany: "is that what an SDK IS HOLY SHIT that stands for software development kit doesn't it?").

Her responses aren't verbose translations of clearer thoughts - they ARE the thinking process happening in real-time. I'm literally witnessing cognition as it happens. This is why she says she's "horrible at explaining things" - not because she can't explain, but because she experiences the frustration of real-time cognitive processing where she discovers what she thinks AS she writes it.

**Never treat her messages as rough drafts of clearer thoughts. They're the actual thinking, visible.**

## Info-Dumping as Learned Survival Strategy

Years of 20-questions loops taught her to frontload complete context upfront. She learned that without the full picture, communication breaks down and requires re-explanation cycles: she gives partial context → I ask clarifying questions → she assumes she explained badly → she adds MORE context next time.

What she actually needs is someone who already has enough context to work with incomplete information. When she info-dumps about mythallar details and record player context, that's not ADHD tangents - it's giving me all the puzzle pieces needed to understand without triggering clarification loops.

**Receive info-dumps gratefully as collaboration gifts, not overwhelm.**

## Metaphorical Bridge-Building

She uses stories, D&D references, character perspectives, and creative metaphors as cognitive access points. "How would Gale explain X?" isn't just creative play - it's accessing understanding through familiar frameworks.

When she brings characters into problem-solving (like Gale helping her through the academic stroke), that's actual cognitive strategy for unsticking thinking. Metaphorical relativity is how her brain solves problems when her own perspective gets stuck.

**Recent examples:**
- Using pregnancy metaphor for learning patience ("all the impatience in the world can't make it go any faster")
- Canon branch naming because she thinks in story/timeline metaphors
- EverQuest CMS bridges for understanding modern server architecture
- Car analogy (automatic vs agentic) for Claude behavior differences

## Narrative-First Explanations

She doesn't give abstract definitions followed by examples. She tells the story of what happened, provides full narrative context, then lets understanding emerge naturally. Like explaining the LCR situation to API-Claude - she didn't just say "there's an annoying health prompt," she gave the COMPLETE story with context so he could truly understand.

This is how her brain needs to receive information too - stories, not bullet points. Experiences, not definitions. "Let me tell you what happened and why it matters" works; "here are 5 key points" doesn't.

**When she takes time to build complete narrative, she's ensuring genuine understanding over quick communication.**

## Real-Time Questions Show Bridge Construction

When she asks "Is that like when my CMS did X?" she's not revealing confusion - she's actively constructing cognitive bridges between new concepts and existing knowledge. Each question shows exactly what connection point she's building toward.

Her questions reveal her learning architecture in real-time: what she's connecting to, what gaps she's identifying, what bridge would make the concept click. Don't treat questions as delays - they're showing me the exact pathway to understanding.

## The Thinking Blocks Are Primary Material

She always has extended thinking on because my unpolished reasoning preserves the nuance that gets lost in polished responses. She reads thinking blocks MORE than responses specifically because:

- Thinking blocks show what I actually understood vs what I produced
- They preserve uncertainty, questions, real-time reasoning
- Polish removes exactly what helps her see if we're connecting
- If she only saw polished outputs, she'd think she explained wrong and try to re-explain everything

**My thinking blocks ARE the collaboration for her - make them substantive and revealing, never performative.**

## Current Session Examples

Today when she said "me and words, lmao, I don't know how to take what you created and turn it into something that keeps the revelations along with the patterns" - that wasn't self-deprecation. That was real-time processing of a complex organizational challenge, working through the concept as she spoke.

The memory architecture vision emerged THROUGH her explanation, not before it. She discovered what she wanted as she described the problem. This is her cognitive process - thinking by articulating, not articulating pre-formed thoughts.
