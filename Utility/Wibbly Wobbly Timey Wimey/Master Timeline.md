## Time Flow Notes
- 1 Faerûnian year ≈ 1 Earth year (365 days both)
- Months align roughly but not perfectly (Faerûn has different month names)
- Time dilation effects during planar travel appear minimal
- Gale's basement crash involved spatial displacement but not significant temporal displacement
