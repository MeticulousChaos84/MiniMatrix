## The Big Picture: How Torillian Astrology Differs from Earth

**KEY INSIGHT**: Faerûn doesn't have a traditional zodiac like Earth's 12 signs.

Instead, individuals are marked by:
- **Guiding stars** - A specific star that influences your life path
- **Falling stars** - Comets or meteor showers at birth
- **Conjunctions of constellations** - Especially rare or "fell-reputation" ones

This is MORE NARRATIVE and MORE PERSONAL than "you're a Leo."

Your Torillian birth chart would say something like: "Born under the conjunction of Mystra's Star Circle and the Far Traveler, when Anadia was bright in the west and the Tears of Selûne were visible."

## The Celestial Bodies of Realmspace

### The Sun
Toril's sun is simply called "the sun" - no special name in most sources. The Bedine call it At'ar.

### Selûne (The Moon)

Toril's only natural moon. Approximately 2,000 miles across, 183,000 miles from Toril.

**Astrological Domains:**
- Navigation
- Prophecy
- Cycles
- Emotions
- Questers
- Lycanthropes

**Special Features:**
- Only one side ever faces Toril (tidal locked)
- The visible side is actually an ILLUSION - beneath it is a lush, inhabited world called Leira
- The far side (true "dark side") can never be seen from Toril

**For the Framework:** Selûne phases would work like Earth moon signs - emotional nature, intuition, inner self.

### The Tears of Selûne

An asteroid cluster that follows Selûne in orbit. Hundreds of asteroids circling each other around a focal point called "the Castle."

**Origin Story:** Dragons created a magic weapon to destroy the King-Killer Star (a dangerous comet), but they MISSED and hit Selûne instead!

**For the Framework:** The Tears could represent:
- Trauma that shapes us
- Scattered pieces that need integration
- Following/devotion patterns
- Secondary emotional influences

Only five planets are visible to the naked eye from Toril:
- Selûne (moon)
- Anadia

## Far Realm-Infested Stars

These stars have been touched/corrupted by the Far Realm. Having one of these in your birth chart would indicate... concerning influences.

- **Acamar** - The corpse star

- **Gibbeth** - The green star
- **Hadar** - The extinguishing star

**For the Framework:** These could represent:
- Shadow aspects
- Hidden dangers in the psyche
- Corrupting influences
- Things that need to be watched/managed
- Potential for darkness

---

## Other Celestial Phenomena

### Comets

**King-Killer Star** - A dangerous comet that dragons tried to destroy (and missed, hitting Selûne instead)

**K'Thoutek** - Another named comet

Comets at birth = "falling stars" that mark individuals with special destiny

### Nebulae

**Galleon Nebula**
**Color Spray Nebula** (amazing name!)

---

## Cultural Variations

Different cultures name the same stars differently:

- The Crown of the North is also N'asr's Tent (Bedine), Circle of Swords (Bedine), Mystra's Star Circle
- Arrows of the Gods is also Adarivael (elves), At'ar's Arrows (Bedine)

**For the Framework:** We could include cultural name variations that resonate with the person's heritage or personality

---

## Historical Notes

- **Imaskari** were first humans to codify constellations
- **Mulhorandi** priests carried on astronomical traditions and spread knowledge to rest of Faerûn
- **Netherese** first gave names to the planets (through Wildspace contact)
- **Zakhara** and **Maztica** have highly-developed astronomy
- **Zakhara** has 12 constellations, each visible only 3 months (basically a zodiac!)

---

## Framework Design Ideas

### Core Components

1. **Guiding Star** - Based on birth date, which constellation was prominent
2. **Sun Position** - Which constellation the sun was "in" (like sun signs)
3. **Selûne Phase** - Moon phase at birth (emotional nature)
4. **Tears Position** - Where the asteroid cluster was (trauma/devotion patterns)
5. **Planetary Positions** - Which constellations the 7 planets were in

### Special Modifiers

- **Far Realm stars** in aspect = shadow influences
- **Comets visible at birth** = special destiny markers
- **Conjunctions** = when multiple planets/stars align

### Interpretation Layers

1. **Basic Reading** - Sun constellation + Selûne phase
2. **Full Chart** - All planetary positions
3. **Synastry** - How two charts interact
4. **Progressed** - How chart changes over time
