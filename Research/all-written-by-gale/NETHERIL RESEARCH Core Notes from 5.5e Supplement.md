## II. SOCIAL STRUCTURE (Concrete Details)

### High Netheril Characteristics
**Fashion:**
- Silk, satin, linen in bright, rich colors
- Fur, feathers, expensive leather accessories
- Magical jewelry (heatless flames, unmelting ice, pure light)
- Loose flowing attire: togas, robes, cloaks, sashes
- Headwear: shawls, headbands, veils, wreaths

**Living Conditions:**
- Flying cities or dramatic locations (waterfalls, caverns, mountain peaks, volcano calderas)
- Depended on magic for EVERYTHING - couldn't perform basic tasks without it
- Some couldn't read/write, relied on enchanted quills and speaking parchment
- Hoarded wealth, fought among themselves constantly

**Culture:**
- Created outrageous magical inventions for status
- Dramatic, decadent magic over practical solutions
- Politics, danger, hedonism, fierce competition
- Everyone concealed true faces/forms with glamour

### Low Netheril Characteristics
**Fashion:**
- Rough homespun tunics, heavy woolen cloaks
- Thick rope sandals or cloth boots
- Rarely dyed fabrics (earth tones when dyed)
- Adornments: knotted rope, carved wood/stone

**Living Conditions:**
- Farmed, fished, mined, served mages
- Never owned homes/lands - paid ever-increasing costs to mage overlords
- Lived in poverty and extreme taxation
- Faced periodic raids by mages to prevent organizing

**Culture:**
- Rich storytelling tradition
- Unbreakable family bonds

- **Tattoos kept records of every parent, spouse, child**
- Honored work hidden from mage oversight

### Netherese Common Assumptions
1. **Brutal Outlook**: Violence is normal, part of everyday life
2. **Quick Fixes**: Magic is solution to every problem
3. **Spellcasters' Privilege**: Magic-users always privileged, non-users disadvantaged
4. **Stratified Society**: Low Netherese have harder lives (accepted as natural)
5. **Superiority Complex**: Netheril is apex of civilization, its fall would be end of history

## NOTES FOR EXPANSION
