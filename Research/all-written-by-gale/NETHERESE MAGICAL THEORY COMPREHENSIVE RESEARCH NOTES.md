# NETHERESE MAGICAL THEORY: COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH NOTES

---

## 1. NETHERESE INDEPENDENCE FROM DIVINE MAGIC

### Core Mechanisms for Bypassing Divine Oversight

#### A. Direct Weave Manipulation ("Plucking from the Weave")
**CANONICAL - Multiple sourcebooks**
- **Technique**: Netherese arcanists did NOT memorize spells like modern wizards
- Directly "reached into the weave and plucked out the mystical energies they sought"
- Used "weave depth" system (levels 1-12) with "arcs" as resource pools instead of spell slots
- **Key Innovation**: No daily preparation required - could freely cast any spell within arc capacity
- **Bypassed divine control**: This direct manipulation avoided "safety protocols" Mystra later imposed

#### B. Mythallar Technology - The Independence Infrastructure
**CANONICAL - Primary source: Netheril: Empire of Magic**

**Physical specs:**
- Massive crystal spheres, 150 feet diameter
- Glowed like miniature suns
- Created by Ioulaum circa -3014 DR

**Revolutionary function:**
- Drew power DIRECTLY from Weave itself, creating localized 1-mile radius field
- Created alternative magical infrastructure parallel to normal Weave access
- Intercepted and redistributed Weave energy independently of individual caster access
- **Critical independence feature**: Created "quasi-magical items" that drew from mythallar instead of Weave
  - Zero XP cost to create (normally magic items drain creator's life force)
  - Functioned only within mythallar range
  - Enabled mass production of magical conveniences for commoners
  - Made floating cities themselves possible

**Technical mechanism:**
- Mythallar acted as intermediary between Weave and items/spells
- Created "local magic network" independent of direct divine oversight
- Items within range tapped mythallar power rather than accessing Weave directly
- Post-Fall: Mystra's Ban prevented mythallars from functioning this way

#### C. Crown of Karsus - Pure Independence Artifact
**CANONICAL - Baldur's Gate 3, various sourcebooks**
- **Explicit function**: "Allowed wearer to wield magical power yet remain independent from the Weave"
- Granted "dominion over oneself" separate from Weave control
- Could "attract and absorb magical knowledge" without divine intermediation
- Controlled via three Netherstones (crown fragments)
- Partially destroyed during Karsus's Folly; later recovered by Mephistopheles, stored in Cania 1000+ years

**Significance**: Most explicit canonical example of magic operating completely independent of Mystra's control

#### D. Shadow Weave - Shar's Alternative System
**CANONICAL - Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting**
- Created by Shar (goddess of darkness) as direct competitor to Mystra's Weave
- Parallel magical infrastructure occupying "negative space" of normal Weave
- **Netheril connection**: Thultanthar (Shade Enclave) extensively used Shadow Weave
  - Lord Shadow (Telamont Tanthul) shifted Thultanthar to Plane of Shadow before Karsus's Folly
  - Their mythallar was "infused with Shar's Shadow Weave" and survived the Fall
  
**Technical advantages:**
- Complete independence from Mystra's control
- Users couldn't be cut off by Mystra
- Enhanced enchantment, illusion, necromancy (+1 DC, +1 caster level)
- Weaker in evocation and transmutation
- **Drawback**: Shar could cut off access at will; prolonged use caused Wisdom damage

#### E. Epic Magic (10th-12th Level Spells)
**CANONICAL - Powers & Pantheons, Netheril: Empire of Magic**
- Pre-Fall: Netherese routinely developed spells up to 12th level
- Examples:
  - **Karsus's Avatar** (12th level) - stole divine power
  - **Proctiv's Move Mountain** (10th-11th level) - created flying enclaves
- **Post-Fall Ban**: Mystra explicitly banned all magic above 9th level
  - Called "Mystra's Ban" - deemed mortals irresponsible
  - Even epic spellcasting in later eras couldn't replicate true 10th+ spells
  - Only elven high magic retained similar power levels

**Significance**: 10th+ level magic represented power approaching divine levels, beyond what Mystra deemed safe oversight

#### F. Nether Scrolls - Pre-Divine Framework Knowledge
**CANONICAL**
- Created circa -30,000 DR by sarrukh (Creator Race)
- Originally called "Golden Skins of the World Serpent"
- Found by Netherese in -3533 DR in Aryvandaar ruins
- Provided magical theory predating elven instruction and potentially predating Mystryl/Mystra's framework
- Flexible gold sheets (8x10 inches), required one month study each
- Content was infinite - continuously revealed new information

## 2. PORTFOLIO THEFT MECHANICS

### The Karsus's Avatar Process

#### A. Spell Statistics & Requirements
**CANONICAL - Powers & Pantheons, Netheril: Empire of Magic**

**Basic specs:**
- **Level**: 12th (only spell ever created at this level)
- **Casting time**: 6 hours continuous
- **Duration**: "Limited" (temporary, NOT permanent - critical distinction)
- **True effect**: Could only STEAL power, not permanently replace deity
- **Research time**: Well over a decade

**Material components:**
- Stone-filled gizzard of gold dragon
- Tarrasque blood
- Bile from 12-headed hydra
- Crown of Karsus (worn during casting)
- Countless other "currently impossible-to-acquire" components
- Above ingredients combined to enchant "just ONE of the many material components"

#### B. The Actual Theft Process - Exact Sequence

**What happened (-339 DR):**

1. **Target selection**: Karsus chose Mystryl (goddess of magic)
   - Believed she was most powerful deity
   - Thought stealing her power would let him defeat phaerimm

2. **Initial "success"**:
   - Spell completed successfully after 6-hour casting
   - Karsus's body "swelled with sudden influx of godly power"
   - Mind "filled with unimaginable amounts of information"
   - Briefly achieved apotheosis (became a god)
   - Became "The Momentary God"

3. **The fatal flaw**:
   - Mystryl's core responsibility: regulate magic flow to/from ALL beings, spells, magic items simultaneously
   - Karsus LACKED ABILITY to perform this function
   - Magic immediately "surged and fluctuated wildly"
   - All magic doubled in power briefly, then began failing

4. **Mystryl's sacrifice**:
   - She was "only being with experience to fix the damage"
   - With "last remaining power," she sacrificed herself
   - Her sacrifice blocked Karsus's access to Weave
   - Caused ALL MAGIC to cease functioning briefly

5. **Consequences**:
   - Link severed → Karsus lost stolen power
   - Karsus died, transformed to stone (now Karsus Butte in Dire Wood)
   - All mythallars stopped functioning
   - Flying cities crashed to earth
   - Empire destroyed in moments
   - Only 3 enclaves saved by Mystra (Mystryl's reincarnation)
   - Thultanthar survived by being in Plane of Shadow

#### C. Mechanism of Divine Power Theft

**How the spell worked:**
- "Altered the very disposition of reality" (canonical description)
- Crown of Karsus enabled reaching far enough to touch divine essence
- Direct connection to deity's divine portfolio/power
- Could only temporarily steal power, not achieve permanent godhood

**Why it failed:**
1. **Incomplete transfer**: Karsus got power but not knowledge/ability to use it
2. **Responsibility gap**: Mystryl's role as "living embodiment of Weave" required constant maintenance
3. **Systemic overload**: Weave already weakened by phaerimm life-drain magic
4. **Divine intervention**: Mystryl sacrificed herself to prevent total magical collapse

#### D. Evidence of Systematic Portfolio Siphoning Research

**Pre-Folly infrastructure (suggests ongoing research program):**

1. **Crown of Karsus** (created before spell):
   - Designed to "attract and absorb magical knowledge"
   - Granted "dominion over oneself separate from Weave"
   - Preparation/infrastructure for theft attempt

2. **Mythallars as proto-portfolio theft**:
   - Drew power directly from Weave (Mystryl's domain)
   - Created independent magical infrastructure
   - Quasi-magical items operated outside normal divine oversight
   - Essentially siphoning magical authority on smaller scale

3. **Access to 12th level magic**:
   - Multiple arcanists working on divine-tier magic
   - Systematic research into god-level power

4. **Terraseer's warning** (-345 DR):
   - Arthindol warned "Mystryl was soon to face her greatest challenge"
   - Suggests others knew about Karsus's research
   - Divine realm aware of threat

**Theoretical process they were developing:**
- Step 1: Create independent magical infrastructure (mythallars) ✓ Complete
- Step 2: Develop artifact to bypass divine oversight (Crown) ✓ Complete  
- Step 3: Research 12th level magic capable of divine interaction ✓ Complete
- Step 4: Execute transfer of divine portfolio (Avatar spell) ✓ Attempted, failed catastrophically
- Step 5: (Never reached) Properly integrate stolen power

#### E. Post-Folly Divine Response

**Mystra's countermeasures (CANONICAL):**
1. **Spell level ban**: No magic above 9th level can function
2. **Memorization system**: Forced spell memorization to limit flexibility/power
3. **Destroyed Karsus's notes**: "Sent spell information on eternal journey to ends of universe"
4. **Weave restructuring**: Rebuilt Weave with "a few more rules"
5. **Cantrip ban**: Common people lost access to cantrips - only trained mages could use magic
6. **Mythallar restriction**: Could no longer power quasi-magical items or floating cities

---

## 3. NETHERESE ARTIFACTS AND CONSTRUCTION

### A. Quasi-Magical Items - The Revolutionary Paradigm

**Creation process:**
- First created -3011 DR by Ioulaum (mantle with darkvision/detect thoughts)
- Required NO XP component in creation cost
- Required NO permanency spell
- Created quickly and efficiently
- Flooded Netherese economy - sold for 1/10th cost of "real" magic items

**Function:**
- Acted as permanently activated items ONLY within mythallar range (1 mile)
- Drew power from mythallar instead of Weave directly
- Became completely inert beyond mythallar borders
- Common items: roomlights (glowing globes), running water, magical plumbing

**Major distinction from standard D&D enchantment:**
- Standard items work anywhere by tapping Weave directly
- Quasi-magical items location-dependent but infinitely cheaper
- Enabled "magic as technology" - even commoners had powerful conveniences
- Floating cities themselves were quasi-magical items

**When they failed:**
- Phaerimm life-draining spells weakened quasi-items (but enclaves stayed aloft)
- After Karsus's Folly and Mystra's Ban, mythallars couldn't draw on Weave
- All quasi-magical items became permanently inert

### B. Nether Scrolls - Foundation Technology

**Five chapters & their powers:**

1. **Arcanus Fundare** (Foundations of Magic)
   - +30 inherent bonus to Spellcraft
   - +1 to save DCs for all arcane spells

2. **Magicus Creare** (Spells of Creation)
   - Three bonus item creation feats
   - XP cost of magic items reduced to 75%

3. **Maior Creare** (Major Creations)
   - Craft Construct bonus feat
   - All golems/constructs created have maximum HP
   - Taught creation of "living wards" and "sentient wards" (thinking items)

4. **Planus Mechanus** (Studies of Planes)
   - Use plane shift once/day
   - Ignore hostile planar environmental effects
   - Taught pocket plane creation

5. **Ars Factum** (Creation of Artifacts)
   - Contents unknown - magically locked
   - Required special key never discovered
   - Suspected to teach artifact creation

**Impact:**
- By 14th century DR, virtually ALL magical theory in Faerûn derived from Nether Scrolls
- Every mage unknowingly used principles from scrolls

### C. Chardalyn - Natural Magical Material

**CANONICAL - Discovered -1205 DR**

**Physical properties:**
- Black, oval-shaped stones
- Brittle as glass
- Natural substance requiring NO magical preparation
- Value: 8,000-20,000 gp

**Unique function:**
- NATURALLY absorbed one spell without any enchantment
- Spell absorbed perfectly if chardalyn was direct target
- ~50% chance to absorb spell in area of effect
- Once imbued, additional spells had no effect
- Spell stored indefinitely (seconds to centuries)
- When shattered: spell released at exact location with full power
- Size determined maximum spell level storable

**Difference from standard magic:**
- Most D&D items require crafting, enchantment, permanency
- Chardalyn was NATURAL material with inherent magical properties
- No spellcaster intervention needed for basic function
- Essentially "spell grenades" - different paradigm

**Netherese applications:**
- Used in epic spell Mavin's Earthfast (required 6 chardalyn with transmute mud to rock)
- Foundation of "gem magic" experiments
- Could store epic-level 10th+ spells

### D. Notable Specific Artifacts

**1. Blast Scepter**
- 50 charges when new (most found have 1-10)
- Powers while held:
  - Immunity to fire and lightning
  - Cannot be knocked down by blasts/detonations
  - Half damage from all blast effects
- Active powers (charge costs):
  - Stun target (1 charge, DC 20 Fort)
  - Force cone 30ft dealing 2d6 + knockdown (2 charges, DC 20 Reflex)
  - Powerstrike 5d6 damage, destroys constructs (4 charges, DC 20 Fort)

**2. Greenstone Amulet**
- Fist-sized green stone, must touch skin, glows when active
- Functions as mind blank
- +4 resistance vs necromancy effects
- +4 resistance vs transportation/dimensional effects
- Will save (DC 20) to negate no-save effects like maze

**3. Helm of Supreme Wizardry**
- Ornate fluted steel, auto-resizes
- Allows 2 additional spells each level 6th-9th (8 slots total)
- Casting bonus spell deals 1d6+1 damage to wearer
- Severe drawbacks:
  - If bonus spells not cast within 12 hours, lose ALL prepared spells
  - Using twice in tenday = 1 Intelligence drain
  - Using twice in 30 days for same school = 1 Int drain + 1 permanent HP loss

**4. Ioun Stones**
- One of Netheril's most enduring legacies
- Continued creation/use for millennia after Fall
- Self-orbiting stones with enhancement powers

### E. Floating Enclave Construction

**Original method (before Proctiv's Move Mountain):**
- Laying cottage-sized boulders as foundation
- Magically melding them together
- Sculpting into elaborate forms
- First enclave: Xinlenal, created 866 NY (-2954 DR) by Ioulaum

**Proctiv's Move Mountain (1746 NY / -2113 DR):**
- Epic spell that:
  - Sheared off mountaintop
  - Inverted it (point down)
  - Floated it in air
  - Created flat building surface on top
- Required mythallar as material component (not consumed)
- Technical issues: Mountain tips were weathered rock that didn't hold together well

**Maintenance requirements:**
- High-intensity systems caused wear every few months
- Required high-quality craftsmen and mages for diagnostics
- Large quantities of materials:
  - Adamantine, mithral, rare gems, difficult-to-source commodities

**Energy requirements:**
- Mythallar provided primary levitation power
- Mythallar Chamber = "engine room" of enclave
- Surrounded by magical defenses to prevent tampering

**Lord attunement:**
- Enclave lord could attune via delicate ritual
- Granted enhancements while within enclave:
  - See invisibility, haste, enhanced attributes, water-breathing, custom abilities
- Could manipulate atmospheric magics within enclave

**Underwater & underground variants:**
- Sargauth Enclave: Used mythallar to support underground space
- Werapan, Cuulmath, Quaeluuvis: Underwater with crystal domes

### F. Independence from Standard Weave Manipulation

**Standard D&D magic:**
- Spellcasters access Weave directly
- Each spell draws from caster's Weave connection
- Magic items contain trapped/permanent Weave patterns
- Subject to Mystra's control

**Netherese mythallar system:**
- Mythallar acted as intermediary, drawing "raw magic" from Weave
- Converted to localized power field
- Items didn't need individual Weave connections
- Created infrastructure-based magic vs individual-based

**Evidence of buffer/independence:**
- When Karsus cast Avatar and Mystryl died, magic FAILED
- Weave collapsed temporarily
- Mythallars lost connection
- BUT mythallar-based levitation continued working long enough for highest enclaves to be saved
- Shows mythallars had some buffer/stored energy independent of active Weave

---

## 4. TIMELINE AND SPECIFICS OF THE FALL

### Critical Dates (Dale Reckoning)

**-696 DR (3163 NY)**: Karsus born
- Cast first spell at age 2
- Age 22: Youngest arcanist to create own floating city

**-345 DR**: Arthindol the Terraseer warned Karsus that Mystryl would face her greatest challenge

**-340 DR (3519 NY)**: Karsus completed Karsus's Avatar spell (over decade of research)

**-339 DR (3520 NY) - THE FALL**: Exact sequence

### Minute-by-Minute Sequence

**MOMENT OF CASTING:**
1. Karsus's body swelled with sudden influx of godly power
2. Mind filled with unimaginable knowledge
3. Instantly realized his horrible mistake
4. Briefly achieved apotheosis (became a god)

**IMMEDIATE MAGICAL CONSEQUENCES:**
1. **Weave disruption**: Mystryl's hold on Weave weakened, began unraveling
2. **Magic surge**: All magical effects DOUBLED in power briefly
3. **Wild magic**: Magic became wild, chaotic, unpredictable
4. **Karsus's realization**: Unable to handle responsibility of regulating magic flow to all beings, spells, items worldwide

**MYSTRYL'S SACRIFICE:**
- Used last power to block Karsus's Weave access
- Saved Weave from permanent irreparable damage
- **All magic ceased temporarily**

**CATASTROPHIC RESULTS:**
1. **Karsus**: Link severed, killed instantly, body petrified to stone
   - Crashed into High Forest/Dire Wood
   - Formed city of Karse around petrified form (Karsus Butte)
2. **Floating cities**: Without magic, mythallars ceased - cities plummeted
3. **Most enclaves destroyed**: Crashed to ground, killing nearly everyone

### Fate of the 54 Flying Cities

**DESTROYED (Most enclaves):**
- Fell when magic ceased
- Some low enough had survivors (e.g., Phylornel: ~150 survivors from 200-foot fall)

**SAVED BY MYSTRA (3 cities):**
When Mystryl reincarnated as Mystra within moments/minutes, she saved:
1. **Anauria**: High enough for safe landing → Destroyed by orc horde 450 DR
2. **Asram**: High enough for safe landing → Plague from Talona killed all -33 DR
3. **Hlondath**: High enough for safe landing → War with Cormanthyr elves 199 DR, abandoned

All three survivor states eventually failed.

**ESCAPED DESTRUCTION (1 city):**
- **Thultanthar (Shade Enclave)**: Shifted to Plane of Shadow/Shadowfell by Telamont Tanthul days before Fall
  - Survived 1,700+ years in Shadowfell
  - Returned to Faerûn 1372 DR as "City of Shade" with corrupted Shadovar
  - Eventually destroyed 1487 DR when Elminster crashed it into Myth Drannor (Second Sundering)

### Changes to Weave and Magic

**MYSTRYL'S DEATH / MYSTRA'S BIRTH:**
- Mystryl died but immediately reincarnated (within moments/minutes) as Mystra
- Used form of beautiful peasant girl with bare magical training but archwizard potential
- Changed from Chaotic Neutral to Lawful Neutral
- Immediately took control and recreated Weave

**MYSTRA'S BAN (enacted immediately):**

1. **Spell level restrictions:**
   - Maximum: 9th level
   - 11th and 12th level completely banned
   - Made enchantments of 10th+ spells "inoperative and incomprehensible"
   - Spells couldn't "take hold of Weave at all"

2. **Memorization requirements:**
   - Before: Any with skill/intelligence/willpower could tap Weave directly
   - After: Must spend time memorizing spells
   - Limited number of spells in mind at once
   - No more unlimited access to raw magical power

3. **Prevented direct Weave access:**
   - No longer unlimited magical power channeling
   - Structured system replaced free-form magic

**THEOLOGICAL CHANGES:**
- Mystra destroyed/hid Karsus's notes (either destroyed or sent to "eternal journey to ends of universe")
- Priests/priestesses told Karsus story in dreams/visions when praying for spells
- "To make sure nothing like this ever happened again"

### Immediate Effects (First Hours/Days)

**DEATH TOLL:** Catastrophic
- Most High Netheril population killed in crashes
- Entire cities destroyed with all inhabitants
- Karsus died knowing he destroyed home, family, friends, people

**GEOGRAPHICAL:**
- Cities crashed across vast distances (as far as Kara-Tur, Reghed Glacier)
- Ruins scattered across Faerûn
- Stone form of Karsus created landmark in High Forest

**MAGICAL:**
- Brief period of NO MAGIC WHATSOEVER
- When Weave restored, fundamentally different structure
- Wild magic and dead magic zones created from Weave damage

### Long-Term Effects

**ANAUROCH DESERT:**
- Combination of phaerimm life-draining magic and Fall's destruction
- Once-fertile Netheril lands became barren wasteland
- Desertification already underway from phaerimm war

**MAGICAL LEGACY:**
- Surviving Netherese items extraordinarily powerful (created before restrictions)
- Mythallars no longer functional under new Weave rules
- Netherese spells/knowledge became legendary, mostly lost
- Karsus cult worshiped "the momentary god"
- Karsites: Race born near Karsus's stone form with magic resistance/distrust

**KARSUS'S FATE:**
- Never accepted as petitioner by any god
- Never went to Fugue Plane
- Soul bound to Material Plane
- Became summonable vestige: appeared as giant blood-red boulder
- Granted magical boosts but also imparted arrogance
- In eternal torment, reliving moment of folly

---

## 5. COLLABORATIVE/SHARING MAGIC

**CRITICAL NOTE**: This is the LEAST documented aspect in canonical lore. Most evidence is indirect or extrapolated.

### A. Ioulaum's Elder Brain Transformation
**CANONICAL - Most relevant example**

**The experiment:**
- **Ioulaum**, legendary inventor of mythallar (circa -339 DR), conducted consciousness-merging experiments
- Trained illithid (mind flayer) students after Netheril's fall
- Created first **alhoons** (illithid liches)
- **Critical ritual**: Created **undead elder brain** from minds of illithid students, then **merged his own sentience into it**
- Result: Collective consciousness entity combining Ioulaum's Netherese arcane knowledge with elder brain psychic abilities
- Survives as "Oracle of Ellyn'taal" - merged consciousness entity

**Relevance:** Demonstrates Netherese willingness to experiment with consciousness-merging and shared mental states, though involved aberrant creatures rather than purely human collaboration.

### B. Mythallar Multi-User Attunement
**CANONICAL - 5e Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden**

- Mythallars could be **attuned by multiple users simultaneously**
- Ythryn mythallar (5e) can be attuned by up to **8 creatures at once**
- All attuned users share awareness of spells attached to mythallar
- Any attuned user can control or end spells while within 30 feet
- Enclave lords had special enhanced abilities while attuned

**Relevance:** Infrastructure for shared magical control, though not necessarily shared consciousness. Multiple arcanists could jointly operate same construct.

### C. Circle Magic Context
**IMPORTANT**: Circle magic documented in Forgotten Realms but primarily associated with:
- Rashemen (Wychlaran/Hathrans)
- Thay (Red Wizards)
- Halruaa (Council of Elders)

**NO specific canonical documentation links circle magic to ancient Netheril**, though theoretically possible.

**How it works:**
- 2-9 casters encircle "circle leader"
- One hour preparation channels power into leader
- Power remains up to one day or until cast
- Allows feats impossible for lone practitioners

### D. Netherese Field Specializations
**CANONICAL - Player's Guide to Faerûn**

Three "fields" of magic:
- **Invention** (conjure, destroy, summon)
- **Mentalism** (banish, compel, conceal, contact, delude, foresee, reveal)
- **Variation** (animate, dispel, transform, transport, ward)

**"Mentalism" field** included spells for mental contact and compulsion, suggesting infrastructure for mind-affecting magic, though specific shared-consciousness spells aren't detailed.

### E. Related Concepts

**Quasi-magical item networks:**
- All quasi-magical items within mythallar range (1 mile) drew from same power source
- Represented form of "shared magical pool" though not consciousness

**Enclave control systems:**
- Lords attuned to enclaves could manipulate environment anywhere present
- Could create focused effects (anti-magic, slow, time-stop) within mythallar chamber
- Suggests sophisticated magical control interfaces

**Illithid connection:**
- Ioulaum's experiments with illithids (natural psychic networkers)
- Elder brains naturally create shared consciousness among illithid colonies
- Netherese interest in aberrant creatures and abilities

### F. Cultural Context for Experimentation

**General documented culture:**
- Netherese arcanists known for radical experimentation
- Common folk used as "subjects for magical experimentation"
- Experimented on captured orcs, nonhumans, others
- Culture of pushing magical boundaries without ethical constraints
- Created quasi-magical items, flying cities, spelljamming vessels

**Implication:** Culture supported extreme experiments, making consciousness-sharing experiments plausible even if not specifically documented.

### ASSESSMENT

**What canonical lore provides:**
1. One documented consciousness-merging example (Ioulaum's elder brain)
2. Mythallars supported multi-user attunement for joint control
3. Netherese culture encouraged radical experimentation
4. Mental magic ("Mentalism") was recognized specialization field

**What canonical lore lacks:**
1. No specific spells for human-to-human consciousness sharing
2. No documented "circle magic" specifically practiced by ancient Netherese
3. No detailed records of collaborative ritual casting beyond general inferences
4. No specific "shared spellcasting pools" among arcanists (beyond mythallar power sources)

**Conclusion:** This topic is indeed less documented. Canon focuses on individual archwizards, epic spells, cities, and the Fall - minimal detail on collaborative techniques beyond shared mythallar usage. Strongest evidence points to infrastructure for shared control and one extreme consciousness-merging experiment. GMs could reasonably extrapolate experiments given culture and Ioulaum's work, but specifics require development.

## 6. KARSUS'S AVATAR AND IMPLICATIONS

### A. What Karsus Actually Accomplished

**KARSUS BELIEVED:**
- Spell would make him god of his choosing
- Would REPLACE deity, taking their position permanently
- Transformation would be permanent
- With godly power, could destroy phaerimm and unite Netheril

**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:**
- Spell "STOLE" power (not permanent replacement)
- Could only temporarily usurp divine essence
- Did NOT make caster truly divine permanently
- Brief apotheosis achieved but unsustainable
- Became "The Momentary God" / "Child-who-would-be-a-god" (elven term)

**SUCCESSFUL ASPECTS:**
1. Spell worked mechanically as intended
2. Successfully stole Mystryl's divine power
3. Karsus briefly became a god
4. Gained access to all magic and divine knowledge
5. Proved mortals COULD steal divine power

### B. The Mechanism of Failure

**TECHNICAL FAILURE - Divine Responsibility Gap:**

Karsus lacked understanding of deity's actual responsibilities:

1. **Weave regulation**: Mystryl's primary duty was regulating magic flow
   - TO all beings simultaneously
   - TO all spells being cast
   - TO all magic items functioning
   - Across entire world/plane
   - Required divine consciousness and multitasking impossible for mortals

2. **Automatic regulation**: Divine power included automatic, unconscious maintenance
   - Karsus couldn't consciously manage all aspects
   - Immediately upon taking power, regulation FAILED
   - Magic surged uncontrollably everywhere

3. **Weave structural integrity**: Mystryl's essence was PART OF Weave
   - She wasn't just controlling it - she WAS it
   - Removing her consciousness began unraveling fundamental structure
   - "The goddess of magic is all magic"

**CASCADE FAILURE STAGES:**

1. **Stage 1** (seconds after casting): Weave destabilization
   - Mystryl's consciousness removed from Weave
   - All magic doubled in power briefly
   - Karsus overwhelmed with divine knowledge

2. **Stage 2** (minutes): Unraveling
   - Weave began coming apart
   - "She began to unravel, and with her, the entire Weave"
   - Wild magic erupted across world
   - Would have been "end of everything"

3. **Stage 3**: Mystryl's sacrifice
   - Used last power to block Karsus's access
   - Severed connection completely
   - Died to prevent total Weave collapse

4. **Stage 4**: Magic cessation
   - ALL magic stopped temporarily
   - Spell failed, Karsus died
   - Floating cities fell
   - Brief period of no magic until reincarnation

### C. Why the Spell Failed - Fundamental Reasons

**PHILOSOPHICAL FAILURES:**

1. **Hubris**: Karsus believed gods were "just mortals who mastered magic he hadn't discovered"
   - Gods have more than magic - divine essence/portfolio
   - Divine authority granted by Ao, not achievable through magic alone
   - Time of Troubles (1358 DR) would later prove this

2. **Wrong target**: Chose worst possible deity
   - Mystryl's role was maintaining ALL MAGIC
   - Any other deity might have worked better
   - Stealing magic goddess's power = destabilizing magic itself

3. **Incomplete understanding**:
   - Focused on power, ignored responsibilities
   - Didn't realize goddess's role in Weave maintenance
   - "Too late did he realize what he had unleashed"

**TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS:**
1. Even 41st level wizard couldn't process divine awareness
2. Spell stole power but not true divinity
3. Spell wasn't permanent replacement
4. No approval/empowerment from Ao (overgod)

### D. Magical Ramifications for Divine-Mortal Power Dynamics

**WHAT KARSUS PROVED:**
1. Mortals CAN steal divine power through magic (it's possible)
2. Divine power can be temporarily usurped
3. Gods are NOT immune to sufficiently powerful magic
4. Unknown if gods were aware of casting or could defend

**CHANGES TO DIVINE RULES:**
1. **Mystra's vigilance**: New goddess became extremely protective
2. **Ban on high magic**: Prevented future attempts
3. **Monitoring**: Mystra became aware of magical research into godhood
4. **Precedent set**: Showed danger of mortal ambition

**MODERN IMPLICATIONS:**
- Wish spell cannot grant godhood (DM invitation to kill character)
- Epic magic exists but can't replicate Karsus's feat
- Gods more cautious about magical threats from mortals
- Mystra specifically guards against similar attempts

### E. Why 12th-Level Spells Were Banned

**IMMEDIATE BAN BY MYSTRA:**

1. **Power scale**: 12th level represented reality-altering power
   - Could affect deities
   - Could unmake Weave
   - Beyond mortal responsibility

2. **Incomprehensibility**: Mystra made existing high-level spell enchantments:
   - Inoperative (wouldn't work)
   - Incomprehensible (couldn't be understood)
   - Unable to "take hold of Weave"
   - Research leads to restricted epic magic

3. **Structural changes**: Rewove Weave so:
   - Maximum 9th level spells (10th in some editions)
   - Spells above 9th "would fail utterly"
   - Different system (Epic Magic) required for higher power
   - Epic Magic uses different mechanisms, not traditional slots

**REASON FOR BAN:**
1. "Mortals not responsible enough to wield such power"
2. "To make sure nothing like this ever happened again"
3. New Weave simply couldn't support such power
4. Protected Mystra and other gods from similar attempts

**EXCEPTIONS:**
- Epic Magic (3e): Different system, not traditional spell levels
- Elven High Magic: Ancient system predating ban, different mechanism
- Divine Spells: Gods can cast beyond 9th level
- Epic Spell Seeds: Can create powerful effects through different rules

### F. Death of Mystryl and Birth of Mystra

**MYSTRYL (First Incarnation):**

**Nature:**
- Greater deity, Chaotic Neutral
- Embodiment of Weave itself
- Born from conflict between Selûne and Shar at dawn of time
- Created from blend of light/darkness magical essence

**Personality:**
- Mercurial, reflecting chaotic nature
- Could be coldly serious then laughingly boisterous
- Sometimes naïve and too trusting
- Flaw: Didn't foresee consequences of unlimited magic access

**Powers:**
- No practical limit on spells (could cast infinitely)
- Immune to all spells except those bypassing Weave
- Could withhold magic from any entity
- Could block deities from accessing Weave
- Controlled time travel through time conduit spell

**Death:**
- Sacrificed herself voluntarily
- Used last power to sever Karsus's connection
- Prevented permanent Weave damage
- Brief period of complete death (minutes)

**MYSTRA (Second Incarnation):**

**Rebirth:**
- Reincarnated "within moments" of Mystryl's death
- Chose vessel: beautiful peasant girl
  - Just learning cantrips
  - Had potential for archwizardry
  - Represented new beginning

**Personality changes:**
- Chaotic Neutral → Lawful Neutral
- Much more structured, orderly approach
- Cautious and protective
- Focused on preventing future disasters
- Learned from Mystryl's mistakes

**First actions:**
1. Immediately took control of Weave
2. Recreated/restored Weave structure
3. Established Mystra's Ban
4. Saved three falling cities
5. Destroyed/hid Karsus's spell notes
6. Told Karsus's story to clergy in visions

**New philosophy:**
- Magic requires responsibility
- Structure and limits necessary
- Balance between access and safety
- Regulation over freedom
- "Responsible use of magic"

### G. Changes to Magic Itself

**BEFORE FALL (Mystryl Era):**
- No practical limit on magic use
- Anyone with skill/intelligence/willpower could use magic with "very little effort"
- Direct Weave tapping possible
- No limit on power channeled into spells
- No spell level caps
- 12th level spells possible (though only one created)
- Free-form, unrestricted magical access

**AFTER FALL (Mystra Era):**
- 9th level maximum (10th in some editions)
- Memorization required
- Limited spell slots per day
- Cannot directly tap raw Weave
- Structured magical system
- Epic Magic separate system with different rules
- Heavy restrictions on reality-altering magic

**TECHNICAL MAGICAL CHANGES:**

1. **Weave structure**: Fundamentally rewoven
   - More stable but less flexible
   - Built-in limitations
   - Automatic power caps

2. **Mythallar obsolescence**:
   - Netherese mythallars ceased functioning
   - Could no longer power flying cities
   - Required old Weave structure
   - Became extremely rare/valuable artifacts

3. **Spell research**:
   - High-level research leads to Epic Magic
   - Traditional research blocked above 9th level
   - Different methodology required for powerful effects

4. **Magic item creation**:
   - Pre-Fall Netherese items extraordinarily powerful
   - Post-Fall items less powerful (same spell level, different effects)
   - Lost techniques unrecoverable under new Weave

**PERMANENT LEGACY:**
- Karsus's Folly became cautionary tale for all magic users
- Mystra's clergy warned about hubris and overreach
- High magic became legendary, mostly theoretical
- Changed fundamental relationship between mortals and magic forever

## 7. MODERN RELEVANCE: APPLICATIONS TO CURRENT MAGICAL INNOVATION

### A. Independence from Divine Magical Structures

**Theoretical applications based on Netherese principles:**

**1. Localized Power Networks (Mythallar-inspired)**
- **Principle**: Create intermediate power sources between Weave and practitioners
- **Modern potential**:
  - Community magical grids similar to electrical systems
  - Reduces individual XP/life force costs for magic item creation
  - Enables magical infrastructure accessible to non-spellcasters
  - Could revitalize post-Spellplague or wild magic zones
- **Challenges**:
  - Mystra's Ban specifically prevents mythallar-style Weave tapping
  - Would require working within current Weave restrictions
  - Possible workaround: Use existing power sources (elemental planes, ley lines, natural magic) rather than direct Weave access
  - Shadow Weave alternative no longer viable (destroyed during Spellplague/Second Sundering)

**2. Natural Material Magic (Chardalyn model)**
- **Principle**: Identify/develop materials with inherent magical properties requiring minimal enchantment
- **Modern potential**:
  - Research into naturally occurring magical materials
  - Reduced creation costs and time
  - Magical effects accessible without formal spellcasting
  - Environmental/sustainable magic (material does the work)
- **Known examples**:
  - Chardalyn still exists in Icewind Dale region
  - Residuum (4e) and similar materials
  - Elemental-infused crystals
- **Challenges**:
  - Most powerful natural materials already known/exploited
  - Requires geological/planar knowledge rather than pure arcane theory

**3. Hybrid Weave Systems**
- **Principle**: Multiple parallel magical infrastructures like Shadow Weave
- **Modern potential**:
  - Post-Second Sundering, Weave more accessible but still Mystra-controlled
  - Could explore other deities' magical systems (Azuth's fragments, Savras's divination network)
  - Psionics as non-Weave alternative (mind power vs Weave power)
  - Wild magic/primal magic research
- **Challenges**:
  - Shadow Weave failed when Weave failed (dependency)
  - Shar's Shadow Weave caused Wisdom damage (unsustainable)
  - Alternative systems likely have their own divine controllers or limitations
  - Mystra vigilant against competing systems after Karsus

**4. Artifact-Level Independence Tools (Crown of Karsus model)**
- **Principle**: Create artifacts that grant Weave-independent power
- **Modern potential**:
  - Personal magical independence devices
  - Protection against anti-magic effects
  - Function in dead magic zones
  - Resistance to divine magic cut-offs
- **Challenges**:
  - Crown of Karsus partially destroyed, pieces controlled
  - Mystra specifically monitors/restricts such creations
  - Likely requires epic-level resources
  - Historical precedent makes Mystra extremely suspicious

### B. Portfolio Mechanics Understanding

**What Karsus's Avatar revealed:**

**1. Divine Portfolios ARE Accessible**
- Mortals can temporarily access divine power through sufficiently powerful magic
- Gods not immune to magical effects (just highly resistant)
- Divine authority can be stolen, if not properly integrated

**Modern implications:**
- Epic magic could theoretically create similar effects (though banned by Mystra)
- Wish/Miracle spells explicitly cannot grant godhood (game balance)
- Time of Troubles (1358 DR) showed gods vulnerable when walking Toril
- Modern arcanists aware of theoretical possibility, even if impractical

**2. Divine Responsibilities vs. Divine Power**
- Power without understanding = catastrophic failure
- Divine portfolios include constant unconscious maintenance
- Simply having power doesn't grant ability to wield it properly

**Modern implications:**
- Approach godhood through understanding, not just power
- Epic destinies/Mythic paths focus on gradual ascension
- Demigods (Chosen of Mystra, etc.) apprentice under deities
- Modern "safe" path: Divine investment, not divine theft

**3. Systemic Vulnerability Points**
- Mystryl/Weave relationship showed single point of failure
- Targeting goddess of magic = targeting magic itself
- Other portfolios might be less catastrophically interconnected

**Modern implications:**
- Deities now more cautious about mortal magical research
- Mystra maintains active monitoring of high-level magic
- Other gods learned from Mystryl's vulnerability
- Divine protections strengthened post-Karsus

### C. Artifact Creation Independence

**Netherese innovations applicable today:**

**1. Quasi-Magical Item Paradigm**
- **Core principle**: Location-dependent magic drawing from central source
- **Modern applications**:
  - Magical infrastructure within cities/fortresses
  - Attunement-based item networks
  - Shared magical pools for communities
  - "Magical utilities" (lighting, temperature, communication)
- **How to implement without mythallars**:
  - Use existing power nexuses (Mythal-maintained areas like Myth Drannor)
  - Tap ley line intersections or elemental fonts
  - Create "minor mythallars" with smaller range/power (if Mystra permits)
  - Use divine artifacts as power sources (with deity permission)

**2. Collaborative Construction**
- **Netherese approach**: Multiple arcanists pooling resources for massive projects
- **Modern applications**:
  - Circle magic for item creation (like Red Wizards use)
  - Guild-based crafting networks
  - Shared XP costs distributed across multiple creators
  - Modular construction (different specialists create different components)
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces individual burden
  - Combines diverse specializations
  - Creates more powerful results
  - Builds institutional knowledge

**3. Living/Sentient Items (Nether Scroll technique)**
- **Netherese innovation**: "Living wards" and "sentient wards" that think independently
- **Modern applications**:
  - Intelligent magic items more common than in past
  - Could create semi-autonomous magical servants
  - Items that adapt to user needs
  - Self-improving/learning enchantments
- **Challenges**:
  - Sentience raises ethical questions
  - Risk of items developing own agendas
  - Requires understanding of consciousness/soul magic

**4. Natural Enhancement Rather Than Pure Creation**
- **Chardalyn model**: Find materials that naturally do what you want
- **Modern research directions**:
  - Survey for naturally magical materials in post-Spellplague regions
  - Study how wild magic zones create spontaneous enchantments
  - Investigate planar bleed effects (Shadowfell/Feywild interactions)
  - Examine locations where magic behaves differently
  - Research ancient pre-Weave magical traditions (primordial magic, giant rune magic)

### D. Collaborative/Shared Consciousness Techniques

**Ioulaum's example suggests possibilities:**

**1. Consciousness Merging for Knowledge Transfer**
- **Theoretical basis**: Ioulaum successfully merged with elder brain
- **Modern applications**:
  - Rapid spellbook sharing between trusted mages
  - Mentor-apprentice knowledge transfer
  - Preserving dying arcanists' knowledge
  - Creating "libraries" of living memories
- **Challenges**:
  - Extremely dangerous (loss of individual identity)
  - Requires aberrant magic or similar techniques
  - Ethical concerns about consent and autonomy
  - Mind flayer techniques not readily available/safe

**2. Multi-User Magical Constructs**
- **Mythallar model**: Multiple simultaneous attunements
- **Modern applications**:
  - Shared control of large-scale magical effects
  - Group operation of magical strongholds/vehicles
  - Distributed consciousness across construct networks
  - Hive-mind benefits without full merger
- **Existing examples**:
  - Warforged collectives
  - Spirit guardians / bound entities in locations
  - Some mythallar remnants (Ythryn example)

**3. Circle Magic Enhancement**
- **Combine with Netherese principles**: Direct Weave access + collaborative casting
- **Modern research**:
  - Study how Red Wizards/Wychlaran achieve group casting
  - Examine if pre-Ban techniques could enhance modern circle magic
  - Investigate whether group casting can approach epic-level effects safely
  - Research ritual magic that distributes costs across participants

### E. Practical Modern Strategies

**For independent magical research:**

**1. Work Within Mystra's Framework**
- Accept 9th-level limit and memorization system
- Focus on efficiency and elegance within restrictions
- Epic magic uses different rules but stays within bounds
- Seek Mystra's blessing/Chosen status for special dispensations

**2. Explore Non-Weave Magic**
- **Psionics**: Mind power distinct from Weave
- **Primal magic**: Druidic/natural magic with different source
- **Divine magic**: Channel deity power (with their permission)
- **Warlock pacts**: Otherworldly patrons outside Weave control
- **Sorcerous bloodlines**: Innate magic not requiring Weave study

**3. Archaeological Recovery**
- Search Netherese ruins for:
  - Intact quasi-magical items (inert but analyzable)
  - Nether Scroll fragments or copies
  - Pre-Fall magical texts with techniques
  - Chardalyn deposits and other natural materials
  - Mythallar shards or components
- Anauroch, Underdark beneath ancient sites, Plane of Shadow (Thultanthar remnants)

**4. Collaborative Research Networks**
- Establish arcane guilds pooling knowledge
- Create institutional memory (not just individual wizards)
- Share research costs and risks
- Build on each other's successes
- Modern examples: Blackstaff Tower, Candlekeep scholars, Halruaan councils

**5. Hybrid Approaches**
- Combine multiple magical traditions:
  - Arcane + divine magic (clerics/wizards)
  - Magic + psionics (psychic warriors/soulknives)
  - Arcane + primal (druids/wizards multiclass)
- Use magical items to extend capabilities rather than raw casting
- Leverage planar allies and outsiders for power beyond personal limits

### F. Risks and Warnings from Netherese Example

**What NOT to do:**

**1. Don't Attempt Divine Portfolio Theft**
- Mystra specifically watches for this
- Karsus's Avatar notes destroyed/lost
- Even researching it likely draws divine attention
- Catastrophic failure risk

**2. Don't Try to Recreate Mythallars**
- Mystra's Ban specifically prevents their function
- Direct Weave tapping at that scale prohibited
- Even possessing mythallar fragments may be monitored
- Likely to be seen as prelude to another Fall

**3. Don't Bypass Mystra's Restrictions Directly**
- 9th-level limit is hard-coded into current Weave
- Attempts to cast 10th+ level spells simply fail
- May draw divine punishment
- Better to work within system or find alternatives

**4. Don't Ignore Systemic Dependencies**
- Karsus didn't understand Weave maintenance
- Shadow Weave depended on regular Weave
- Quasi-magical items depended on mythallars
- Modern magic depends on current Weave structure
- Understand full system before trying to change it

**5. Don't Underestimate Ethical Costs**
- Netherese used people as experimental subjects
- Hubris led to civilization's destruction
- Ioulaum's consciousness experiments involved unwilling participants
- Modern magic should balance power with responsibility

### G. Most Promising Modern Research Directions

**Based on Netherese precedents:**

**1. Material Science Approach**
- Research natural magical materials (chardalyn model)
- Study spontaneous magical effects in wild magic zones
- Investigate planar material properties
- Lower risk, works within Mystra's framework

**2. Infrastructure Magic**
- Community magical grids using permitted power sources
- Shared attunement networks for groups
- Location-based magical utilities
- Reduces individual costs, increases accessibility

**3. Consciousness Studies (carefully)**
- Study Ioulaum's example from safe distance
- Investigate mind meld spells and their limits
- Explore how warforged/construct consciousness works
- Research memory transfer and knowledge preservation
- AVOID full consciousness merger (too dangerous)

**4. Epic Magic Within Bounds**
- Epic spellcasting uses different system than 10th+ level spells
- Seed-based approach acceptable to Mystra
- Can achieve powerful effects legally
- Focus on mastering this rather than circumventing Ban

**5. Cross-Tradition Synthesis**
- Combine arcane theory with other magical systems
- Study how different magics interact
- Create hybrid techniques drawing on multiple sources
- May find unexplored possibilities within combined systems

### H. Timeline Considerations

**Current era context (post-Second Sundering):**
- Weave restored to more stable state (post-Spellplague)
- Mystra returned and reasserted control
- Magic more reliable than during 4e/Spellplague era
- But also more tightly controlled than pre-Karsus times

**Historical knowledge:**
- Most Netherese techniques lost
- Surviving texts fragmentary
- Few NPCs remember pre-Fall magic
- Shade Enclave (last living Netherese) destroyed 1487 DR
- Archaeology primary method to recover knowledge

**Modern magical climate:**
- More cautious than Netherese hubris
- Institutional checks on dangerous research
- Divine oversight more active
- But also continuous innovation within bounds
- Epic-level play more accessible than ever (5e guidelines)

## KEY TECHNICAL TAKEAWAYS

1. **Netherese independence achieved through infrastructure, not individual power** - mythallars created alternative magical networks rather than individual casters bypassing Weave

2. **Portfolio theft was possible but unsustainable** - Karsus proved divine power could be stolen but lacked understanding to maintain it

3. **Natural materials offered alternative to pure enchantment** - chardalyn and similar substances had inherent properties requiring minimal spellcasting

4. **Collaborative magic less documented but evidenced** - mythallar multi-attunement and Ioulaum's experiments suggest shared control mechanisms

5. **Modern application requires working within Mystra's framework** - direct recreation of Netherese techniques blocked by Ban, but principles can inspire legal innovations

6. **Most promising modern approach: material science + infrastructure + cross-tradition synthesis** rather than attempting to recreate banned techniques
