## Post-Mystra's Ban Weave Theory: The Water I Swim In

### What They Don't Tell You in Sourcebooks

The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide says "the Weave is the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven." Technically accurate. Utterly insufficient.

Here's what that actually means when you're standing in your study at dawn, preparing your spells for the day:

The Weave is _everywhere_. Running through the floorboards beneath your feet, threaded through the morning light streaming through your window, woven into the very fabric of the air you breathe. You don't see it - _detect magic_ won't reveal it, no more than holding up a magnifying glass will let you see the space between atoms - but if you have the talent, you _feel_ it.

It's like... imagine standing in an ocean. The water surrounds you, supports you, flows through your fingers when you reach out. But you're not swimming yet. You're just _there_, aware of the medium, feeling its currents and eddies. That's what having magical talent means - you're not separate from the Weave. You're immersed in it. Always have been.

### Memorization: The Cage That Keeps Us Safe

Before Karsus's Folly (-339 DR), arcanists could reach directly into the Weave and pluck out whatever magical energies they sought. No preparation required. No artificial limits. Just raw talent and will shaping reality.

Mystra changed that immediately upon her reincarnation. Not out of malice - though I've had... _complicated_ feelings about her motivations - but because she watched the entire Netherese civilization crash to earth when Mystryl died. Magic failed completely. Cities fell. Thousands died instantly.

She restructured the Weave with what she calls "a few more rules." What we call "the memorization system."

Here's how it works in practice:

Every morning, I sit with my spellbook - well, spellbooks plural, I've filled several over the years - and I _prepare_ my spells. Not "memorize" in the sense of rote learning, but something more fundamental. I'm... pre-weaving patterns. Taking threads of the Weave and arranging them into specific configurations in my mind, holding them ready.

It feels like... have you ever prepared all your ingredients before cooking? Mise en place, the culinary term. Everything measured, chopped, arranged within reach. That's spell preparation. I'm not casting anything yet - I'm just making sure the components are ready when I need them.

Then, during the day, when I actually cast a spell - say, _fireball_ - I'm releasing one of those pre-woven patterns. The mental construct I prepared flows out, interacts with reality, produces the desired effect. And then it's _gone_. Used up. I can't cast that same spell again until I prepare another copy tomorrow.

This is the fundamental paradigm shift from Netherese practice. They could pull power directly from the Weave

as many times as their skill and stamina allowed. We're limited to what we prepare in advance.

**Why this matters:** It's a safety mechanism. By forcing us to prepare spells rather than channel raw Weave-stuff, Mystra ensures nobody can accidentally (or deliberately) draw too much power and destabilize the Weave itself. Karsus did exactly that - reached for more than any mortal should wield, grabbed hold of Mystryl's divine essence, and broke the entire system.

We're swimming in a pool with lane dividers now. Yes, we're constrained. But we're also _protected_. And so is everyone else.

### Spell Slots: Measuring the Unmeasurable

The sourcebooks describe spell slots as "available magical energy." That's... technically true but misleadingly simple.

Think of it this way: I can prepare multiple copies of the same spell - say, three _fireballs_ - but they all draw from the same "level" of complexity. First-level spells (cantrips technically don't count) are simple constructs. Third-level spells like _fireball_ are more intricate. Ninth-level spells are monumentally complex.

I have a certain... _capacity_ for holding these pre-woven patterns. Not infinite. Not arbitrary. It scales with experience and power, yes, but there are hard limits.

Currently, as an experienced archmage, I can prepare and cast:

- Numerous cantrips (these don't expend slots - I'll explain why shortly)
- Multiple first through ninth level spells, with decreasing numbers as complexity increases

The ninth-level slots are precious. I get very few. And when I use one - say, casting _wish_ or _time stop_ - I can't prepare another ninth-level spell until tomorrow morning's preparation ritual.

**What this feels like:**

Casting a cantrip? Like breathing. Effortless. The pattern is so simple it doesn't need preparation - I can weave it spontaneously. _Fire bolt_, _light_, _mage hand_ - these are as natural as reaching for a cup of tea.

Casting a third-level spell like _fireball_? Purposeful but manageable. I release the prepared pattern, it flows out, makes contact with reality, combusts. Done. But I'm aware I've used something finite.

Casting a ninth-level spell? _Exhausting_. Even with preparation, even with years of practice, channeling that much concentrated Weave-manipulation leaves me winded. It's like... sprinting uphill carrying heavy weights. Possible, yes. But you feel it.

And if I try to cast a ninth-level spell when I've already used all my ninth-level slots? Nothing happens. The

pattern won't form. It's not that I've "run out of mana" in video game terms - it's that my mind can only hold so many complex pre-woven patterns, and I've expended them all.

### The Ninth Level Cap: Mystra's Absolute Ban

This is where it gets interesting. And terrifying.

Karsus created a twelfth-level spell. _Karsus's Avatar_. Used it to steal Mystryl's divine power. Briefly became a god. Then died when Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the Weave, severing his connection and turning him to stone mid-apotheosis.

Mystra's immediate response upon reincarnation was categorical: **No magic above ninth level can function. Period.**

Not "it's very difficult." Not "only with special permission." It literally _won't work_. The Weave itself has been restructured to reject any attempt to cast tenth-level or higher spells.

**What happens if you try:**

I've seen the research. Historical accounts from immediately post-Fall, when desperate arcanists tried to recreate the high magic their predecessors had wielded. The spell formulas are _incomprehensible_ now. Not in the sense of being difficult to understand, but in a more fundamental way - they don't connect properly to the Weave anymore. It's like trying to run software designed for an operating system that no longer exists.

And if someone somehow managed to force it? The Weave would... shrug it off. Reject the construct. Possibly backlash violently. Mystra built the ninth-level cap into the fundamental architecture.

**Why this haunts me:**

I came within a hairsbreadth of being forced to use that level of power. The orb - my lovely, temperamental, now-externalized Sparky - contained Karsite Weave fragments. Netherese magical artifacts that _predate_ Mystra's restrictions. When Mystra sent Elminster with her "gift" of "forgiveness," the message was clear: use the orb to destroy the Absolute's Netherbrain. Detonate yourself. Tenth-level-spell-equivalent destructive power.

I refused. Chose mortality, friendship, and messy imperfect life over that kind of power.

But I understand the _appeal_ now. That's what's terrifying. Karsus looked at the ninth-level cap and thought "but what if I could transcend these limitations?" And I've had that exact thought. Multiple times.

Understanding why the cap exists - genuinely, viscerally understanding what happens when mortals wield god-level power - is the only thing that keeps hubris in check.

### Daily Practice: How This Actually Shapes My Life

Right. Let's bring this down from cosmic significance to mundane reality.

Every morning, I wake up. Make tea. Sit with my spellbooks. Begin the preparation ritual.

**What this looks like:**

I'm not just memorizing words or gestures. I'm _feeling_ the Weave, reaching into it, pulling specific thread patterns into my consciousness and holding them ready. It takes about an hour for a full day's preparation - longer if I'm preparing particularly complex spells.

Some days I prepare offensively - multiple _fireballs_, _lightning bolts_, area control. Other days defensively - _shield_, _counterspell_, protective wards. Often a mix. It depends on what I expect the day to hold.

And here's the thing: **I have to guess**. Once I've prepared my spells, I'm committed until tomorrow. If I prepare heavy combat magic and spend the day in academic meetings, I've wasted preparation time. If I prepare utility spells and encounter a phaerimm, I'm in trouble.

This is why experience matters. After forty-odd years of practice, I've developed intuition for what I'll need. But it's never perfect.

**Cantrips: The Exception That Proves the Rule**

Cantrips don't require preparation because they're so simple that any trained spellcaster can weave them spontaneously. They're like... basic motor skills. Walking, picking up objects, tying your shoes. You don't need to prepare the neural pathways - they're already there.

For me, cantrips include:

- _Fire bolt_ (my go-to combat option when I don't want to expend higher-level slots)
- _Light_ (because walking around in darkness is foolish)
- _Mage hand_ (endlessly useful for reaching things without getting up)
- _Prestidigitation_ (cleaning spills, lighting candles, minor conveniences)

I can cast these _all day_ without exhaustion. They're not free - they still require channeling the Weave - but they're effortless enough that the Weave naturally

replenishes what I draw faster than I can deplete it.

### Teaching This to Students

Here's where I have to be honest about something uncomfortable:

Most of my students at Blackstaff Academy will never reach ninth-level casting. Many will cap out around fifth or sixth level. Some will struggle to reliably cast third-level spells.

This isn't a judgment of their intelligence or dedication. It's just... reality. Magical talent, like any talent, has limits. And the memorization system Mystra imposed has _steep_ learning curves.

**Common student mistakes:**

1. **Trying to cast without preparation** - "But I KNOW the spell, why can't I just—" No. Doesn't work that way. You must prepare it first.
    
2. **Over-preparing complex spells** - Preparing six ninth-level spells when you can only hold two slots means you've wasted effort on four that won't be accessible.
    
3. **Forgetting cantrips exist** - Students default to expending spell slots for simple problems when a cantrip would suffice.
    
4. **Misunderstanding spell slot recovery** - No, you can't "rest for an hour" and get your slots back. Full night's sleep. Eight hours. That's the reset.
    
5. **Assuming more power = better results** - Sometimes a precisely placed first-level _magic missile_ accomplishes more than a poorly aimed fifth-level _cone of cold_.
    

That last one is where I spend most of my teaching energy. Power without precision is just... destruction. Elegance comes from using _exactly_ the right amount of force for the desired effect.

### What They Don't Teach You: The Sorcerer Exception

And now we come to the bit I'm still processing.

Everything I just described? The memorization system, spell slots, preparation rituals? _That's wizard magic._ Learned manipulation of the Weave through study and practice.

Sorcerers don't work that way.

According to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide:

> "The Weave of magic infuses every part of the Realms, and some people have the natural ability to perceive, touch, and shape the Weave."

Sorcerers have _innate_ connections to the Weave. They don't prepare spells in advance - they manipulate the Weave spontaneously, the way beholders fly or dragons breathe fire. It's not learned. It's _intrinsic_.

**What this means for me personally:**

I spent thirty years believing I was a wizard. That everything I could do came from study, discipline, carefully learned technique. That my abilities were _earned_.

Then I discovered I'm actually a sorcerer. Specifically - and this is freshly documented in the new Heroes of Faerûn supplement - a **spellfire sorcerer**. My power stems from direct connection to the Weave itself, amplified by Netherese bloodline.

Everything I thought I knew about how MY magic works might be... not wrong, exactly, but incomplete.

The memorization system still applies to me - Mystra's restrictions affect everyone. But the _ease_ with which I prepare spells, the way I've never encountered a magical conduit I couldn't instinctively use, the fact that I maintained perfect magical ability during the Spellplague when even Elminster struggled?

That's not wizard excellence. That's sorcerous bloodline manifesting through wizard training framework.

I'm still processing what this means. For my teaching, for my self-understanding, for everything.

But it changes the water I swim in, doesn't it? The Weave isn't just something I've learned to manipulate carefully. It's something I'm _part of_. Always have been.

### Practical Implications: Why Understanding Restrictions Creates Elegance

Right. Back to teaching mode, because this is what matters for the lexicon:

The ninth-level cap isn't a limitation I resent. It's a framework I work _within_. Constraints breed creativity.

When you know you have finite spell slots, you become more strategic. You learn to solve problems with cantrips when possible. You reserve high-level magic for situations that truly demand it. You discover that sometimes the most elegant solution isn't the most powerful one.

Example from last week:

Student came to me frustrated. Trying to unlock a magically sealed door, kept attempting _knock_ (second-level spell, expends a slot). Failed repeatedly because the door had additional protections.

I walked over. Cast _mage hand_ (cantrip, effortless). Manipulated the lock mechanism from inside the frame through a crack in the door. Click. Open.

Student: "But... that's not... you didn't even—"

Me: "Power is only as useful as your imagination for applying it. Save your spell slots for problems that actually require them."

This is what I mean by elegance. The Weave is limitless, yes. But our access to it is constrained. Learning to work brilliantly within those constraints - that's the _art_ of magic.

### In Conclusion: The Water I Swim In

The Post-Mystra's Ban Weave isn't just "the rules of magic" for me. It's the medium through which I

experience reality.

I don't think "I should prepare _fireball_ today because game mechanics." I think "I should prepare _fireball_ because I might need precise area control this afternoon and it's more reliable than relying on wild magic effects."

The ninth-level cap isn't an arbitrary limitation. It's the scar tissue where the Weave healed from Karsus's hubris. You can feel it, if you know what to look for - a sort of resistance when you reach toward that level of complexity.

And the memorization system? It's not "game balance." It's Mystra saying "I love you foolish mortals, but I will not let you destroy yourselves - or my Weave - through unchecked ambition again."

Is it restrictive? Yes.

Does it frustrate me sometimes? Absolutely.

Do I understand _why_ it exists, and respect it even when it limits me?

Gods help me, yes.

Because I've held power that nearly destroyed me. I've felt the temptation of transcending limits. And I've chosen - repeatedly, consciously - to work within the framework rather than trying to shatter it.

That's what it means to truly understand Post-Mystra's Ban Weave Theory.

Not just knowing the mechanics. _Living_ the implications.
