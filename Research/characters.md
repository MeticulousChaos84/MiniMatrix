### Key Findings

- **Astarion** has the most comprehensive source material (2025 supplement provides complete timeline 1261-1501 DR)
- **Elminster** and **Volo** function as narrative devices as much as characters
- **Khelben's** pragmatic philosophy (willing to arm evil to defeat worse evil) set him apart from other heroes
- **Manshoon's** stasis clone system creates fascinating identity questions—at least one "original" clone still sleeps in hiding
- **Laeral Silverhand** carries significant unexplored grief about her family
