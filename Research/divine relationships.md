### Notes for Further Research

Each file includes a "Further Research Needed" section flagging gaps in the available sources. Notable areas requiring additional investigation:

- The exact mechanism of Mystra's return during the Second Sundering
- Complete details of the Seven Sisters' individual histories
- Specific events during the Time of Troubles
- The current relationship between the returned Dead Three
